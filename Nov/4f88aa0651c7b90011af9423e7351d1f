The Director, Corporate Communications, CBN, Mr. Isaac Okorafor, who disclosed this in a statement on Saturday, attributed the development to the public holiday declared by the federal government to mark the Eid-El Maulud celebration. “The November 2018 meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has been rescheduled from Monday and Tuesday, 19th & 20th November to Wednesday and Thursday, 21st and 22nd November, 2018, as a result of the declaration of Tuesday, 20th November, 2018, as a public holiday by the federal government. “The CBN regrets any inconvenience this change may have caused its stakeholders and the general public,” the two-paragraph statement explained. At its meeting in September 2018, the MPC had maintained the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 14 per cent, with the asymmetric corridor at +200 and -500 basis points around the MPR; it also retained the cash reserve ratio (CRR) and liquidity ratio (LR) at 22.5 per cent and 30 per cent respectively.
