Ugo Aliogo The Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH) is 40. As part of activities to commemorate its 40th anniversary celebration, it would be rewarding staff who have served the institution for many years at the convocation ground, Ikorodu Campus. Already, the Chairman, Heirs Holding, Mr. Tony Elumelu on November 20, delivered its 40th anniversary lecture titled ‘Repositioning Education for Technological Development and Food Security’. Briefing journalists recently in Lagos, the Rector, Mr. Samuel Sogunro, said the anniversary is aimed at celebrating the unity, peace and development which the institution has achieved in the last 40 years. “If there is unity, there is development. It is not something that is hidden. In an administration you will find ups and down. When you have issues, you resolve it and at the same time you work together to develop the institution. If there is no peace and unity in any setting definitely, there can’t be progress. As far as we are concerned this is 40 years and it is not easy to mark 40 years,” he stressed. “If you look round and see what we have been able to do within the space of 40 years, you will know we have really tried. We started with five departments and now we have 36. “We were running five programmes at the beginning, now we are running 67 programmes. Recently, we just faced re-accreditation of 66 our programmes, if there is no unity we can’t achieve that much so definitely we are going to intensify our efforts to bring everyone together because we can always do it together to achieve the expected growth and development.”
