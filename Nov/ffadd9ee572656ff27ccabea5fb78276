*As Ghana unseals 400 Nigerian-owned businesses By Deji Elumoye in Abuja Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, has lauded the bold step taken by Government of Ghana to unseal over 400 Nigerian-owned shops in the West African country. Ekweremadu, a former Speaker of the Parliament of the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS Parliament, in a statement on his Facebook page, @iamekweremadu, on Saturday, urged the 15-member states of the sub-regional body to pursue only policies and laws that make ECOWAS citizens feel at home in every part of West Africa. “I have been keeping a tab on the sealing of over 400 Nigerian-owned businesses in Ghana, especially in Kumasi, by that country’s authorities. “Therefore, my heart was gladdened when the Regional Minister of Ashanti, Hon. Simon Osei-Mensah, called to inform me that the affected shops had been unconditionally unsealed. “The President of the Nigerian Union of Traders Associations, Ghana, Mr. Chukwuemeka Nnaji, also reached me to confirm the development. Accordung to him, “this is the true African spirit and show of ECOWAS brotherhood. “I want to convey special appreciation to Ghanaian authorities, especially the Regional Minister of Ashanti, my dear friend, brother, and former Deputy at the ECOWAS Parliament, Hon. Osei-Mensah, for this. The lawmaker also commended the Nigerian Government for showing concern in this matter. “As I have always maintained, we must all work hard both as individuals and governments to uphold the spirit, letters, and sanctity of the various ECOWAS Protocols to be able to realise the ECOWAS Vision 2020, which aims at transforming the sub-region from an ECOWAS of States to ECOWAS of peoples. “Importantly, we must continue to encourage only laws and policies that promote the free movement of persons, goods, and services, ensuring that every citizen of West Africa feels at home in any part of the sub-region”, Ekweremadu further said.
