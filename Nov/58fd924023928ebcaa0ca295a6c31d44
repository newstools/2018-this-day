Fulham has sacked manager Slavisa Jokanovic and replaced him with Claudio Ranieri, who guided Leicester to the Premier League title in 2016. Jokanovic makes way with the Cottagers sitting bottom of the Premier League table with five points from 12 matches. Italian Ranieri, 67, has been given a “multi-year” contract by the Londoners. “Making a change without having the right answer or succession plan was not an option,” said Fulham chairman Shahid Khan. “So having someone of Claudio’s calibre ready to accept our challenge was comforting but, most of all, essential. “Claudio is risk-free and ready-made for the Premier League, and particularly so for what we need at this moment at Fulham. “His recent body of work with Leicester City is literally legendary, and then you look at Claudio’s experience with Chelsea and big clubs throughout Europe, and it’s pretty evident we are welcoming an extraordinary football man to Fulham Football Club.”
