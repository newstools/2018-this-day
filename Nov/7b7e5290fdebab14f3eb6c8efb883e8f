With less than 24 hours to the much-advertised 3rd edition of the Lagos Women Race, thousands of runners from across Lagos have collected their kits in readiness for the 2018 edition. The collection of kits marks the beginning of a two-day Expo which ended yesterday. Prior to that all the runners were given tips on the techniques of running a mini-marathon and health talks on wellness by carefully selected professionals. Also present at the venue of the Expo are staff of Forever Vision Eye Centre, who were engaged in the eye screening exercise for the runners ahead of Saturdayâ€™s 10-kilometre race. The eye screening, according to the Consultant Ophthalmologist on ground, Dr. G.F Yusuf, will continue today and tomorrow so as to get to a large percentage of the runners. Meanwhile, former Nigerian hurdler, Glory Alozie, has thrown her weight behind the Lagos Women Run. She gave her support in a telephone message with the Run Coordinator, Tayo Popoola. Olympic 4x400m gold medalist, Enefiok Udo-Obong, has been assigned the role of co-ordinating the over 150 volunteers who will be working in all departments of the Lagos Women Run on Saturday. Enefiok yesterday confirmed his sponsorship and provision of the volunteers attire for the event. He will also be responsible for their training and seminar towards maximum output on Saturday. The 10-kilometre run will flag off at the Tafawa Balewa Square, and passing through 15 historical sites in Lagos including the National Theatre. Teslim Balogun Stadium in Surulere is the finish point of the race. The Run Coordinator, Tayo Popoola, confirmed that aside from the finish point where there would be entertainment, there would also be an entertainment point at the National Theatre.
