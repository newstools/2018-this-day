Alex Enumah in Abuja The Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Monday shed more light on why the commission was seeking extradition of a former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mrs. Diezani Alison-Madueke, from the United Kingdom. Barely 24 hours after a spokesman of the commission, Mr. Tony Orilade, confirmed that the EFCC had commenced the process of extraditing Alison-Madueke, Chairman of the commission, Ibrahim Magu insisted the former minister must be brought back to answer to corruption allegations against her since the UK government was yet to prosecute her three after it carried out investigations on her. Magu gave the explanation Monday in Abuja while answering questions on efforts of his administration in the fight corruption. “It is unreasonable that she is not been tried there”, he said, adding, “there is no trial going on in the UK.” While lamenting that investigation by the UK government is taking so long, the acting chairman of the anti graft agency, said Nigeria can no longer wait for the UK hence the need for Alison-Madueke to be brought back, adding that the EFCC has everything to prosecute the case and is fully ready to do so. “Three years is sufficient to conclude investigation and try her but no one is prosecuting her there. So that is why we want her here”, he said. Apart from Diezani, Magu disclosed that the EFCC is making concerted efforts with international agencies and governments to ensure all corrupt persons don’t go free. According to him, efforts at prosecuting all those involved in the Malabu oil deal would soon yield desired results. On why the commission is not probing the bribery allegations against Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, the commission said the matter was in court.
