Despite the negative impact of the Apapa gridlock that affected its half-year performance, analysts see huge potential in Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc, writes Goddy Egene Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc (FMN) is a leading manufacturer of food and agro-allied products. The company has a highly diversified product base with huge potential to deliver good returns on investments. Although the company has been recording positive results over the years, it ended the half year(H1) to September 30, 2018 with lower bottom-line due to the general difficult economic environment, the Apapa traffic and logistics challenges. The company announced a revenue of N269.737 billion and profit after tax(PAT) of N5.069 billion for the H1 2018. FMN recorded a 49 per cent increase in selling and distribution expenses to N4.13 billion, compared to N2.77 billion of the same period last year, as it increased its marketing spend. Administrative expenses rose to N9.852 billion, compared with N8.352 billion, while finance cost fell from N16.267 billion to N11.229 billion in 2018.
The reduction in finance cost came as a result of settlement of overdraft facilities and replacement of high interest yielding loan facilities with cheaper loan facilities. Investment income grew by six per cent to N290 million, from N270 million of the same period as last year. The increase was due to short-term investments. However, profit before tax fell to N8.392 billion, from N13.477 billion while PAT stood at N5.069 billion as against N9.355 billion in 2018. Company explains performance
Commenting on the result, the Group Managing Director of FMN, Paul Gbededo, said: “In the face of persistent economic challenges and a difficult operating terrain, we continue to pursue our growth strategy to gain market share in all key product segments. Operations in Apapa continues to suffer major setbacks in traffic and logistics challenges, impacting in a marginal drop in our volume and top line activities.
With improved marketing and promotional activities for most of the key food businesses, we envisage new gains in the remaining part of the year, as we continue to focus on innovative products that deliver on great consumer experience.”
Gbededo had said the company’s focus remained on growing and building long-term value for stakeholders, following the successful raising of N39.9 billion through a right issue early this year.
“The Rights Issue is aimed at strengthening our balance sheet and positioning the Company for sustainable growth. We value the strong level of support shown by our shareholders and our focus remains on growing and building long-term value for all stakeholders,” he said. Analysts’ Assessment
Looking at the results of the company, analysts at FSDH Research, said the financial performance of FMN Plc suffered from the temporary tough operating environment in H1 2018. They explained that the gridlock in the Apapa area of Lagos,where the company has its main business operations has increased the cost of running the business and increased delivery time. According to them, the weak purchasing power and the weak economic performance in Nigeria have had negative impacts on the operations of the company.
The analysts said the drop in revenue was as a result of the company’s strategy to focus on market leadership. “This means an increase in volume of sales in some product categories at lower selling prices in response to lower input cost. Thus, customers received more value for their money. Our analysis of the company’s revenue by business segment shows that food accounted for 64 per cent of the company’s total revenue. The company’s cost of sales (COS)decreased by 9.63 per cent to N237.62 billion from N262.93 billion in H1 2017. Despite the decline in COS, gross profit decreased by 9.56 per cent to N32.12 billion in H1 2018 from N35.51 billion in H1 2017. Its COS as a percentage of turnover remained flat at 88.09 per cent in 2018 from 88.10 per cent in 2017,” FSDH said.
The company said it was mostly as a result of increased marketing activities geared to boost the top line.
“FSDH Research believes the difficulties in moving goods around the country especially in Apapa because of the bad transportation system contributed to this. However, reconstruction work is going on to ease traffic in the area,” it said. The company’s Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) decreased by 34.71 per cent to N19.24 billion from N29.47 billion in 2017 The company recorded a net finance charge of N10.94 billion in 2018, a decrease of 31.60 per cent from N15.99 billion in 2017.
“This was a reflection of debt refinancing through the Rights Issue as well as a drop in interest rate in the market. The PBT fell by 38.4 per cent to N8.30 billion in 2018 from N13.48 billion recorded in 2017. The PAT was N5.07 billion in 2018, from N9.36 billion in 2017, representing a decrease of 45.81 per cent.
