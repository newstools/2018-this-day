By Kayode Fasua A group of online opinion pollsters, Truly Independent Diaspora Electoral Officers (TIDEO), has sensationally revealed that eight presidential aspirants will come tops in the February 2019 poll.  In its statement dated November 1, 2018, which was obtained by THISDAY, TIDEO came short of declaring who will actually win the presidential election.  Of the 61 political parties and their respective candidates it thrust out in its opinion poll, only eight contenders could win and become the next president, according to the group.  They include President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC); former Vice President Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); Omoyele Sowore of Africa Action Congress (AAC), Fela Durotoye of Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN) and Kingsley Moghalu of the Young Progressive Party (YPP).
