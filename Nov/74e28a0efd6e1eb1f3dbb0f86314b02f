In commemoration of this year’s International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists (IDEI) 2018, the International Press Centre (IPC), Lagos-Nigeria is organising a tweet conference and media roundtable, where a human rights lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Mr. Femi Falana will speak. The event, which is part of the “Nigerian Journalists Internet Rights Initiative (NJIRI),” is being supported by the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX). The objective is to advance the right to freedom of expression for online journalists in Nigeria. It is premised on ensuring that internet spaces and online platforms are safe and free of institutional limitations for journalists and other media practitioners to use as mediums of information and engagement. Director of IPC, Mr. Lanre Arogundade in his statement said, “The goal of the initiative is to facilitate a free and safe online environment for journalists and other media professionals in Nigeria and ensure that the right to freedom of expression for online journalism in Nigeria is respected, protected and guaranteed.” “The keynote address is to be delivered by Mr. Femi Falana, Human Rights Lawyer and Activist. The event will also feature Journalists, Bloggers, Media Professional Associations/Unions; Media support groups, CSO groups, human rights/freedom of expression activists from civil society platforms and institutional stakeholder representatives. The participants are expected to engage in a tweet session through a dedicated hash tag, and Face book posts, to concerned government agencies, public officials, respective stakeholders and the general public online,” Arogundade said. IPC therefore urges the media and general public to follow the conversations on twitter using any of the following, #Internet Rights, #End Impunity, #Journosafe.alik
