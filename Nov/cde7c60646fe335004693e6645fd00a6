The Nigerian Army has reappointed Brig.-Gen. Sani Usman as its spokesman. In a statement posted on its WhatsApp platform Friday, the army said Usman’s re-appointment followed his completion of the Strategic course at the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), at Kuru in Jos. The army maintained that the re-appointment of Usman was routine, and not as a result of media management by the current spokesman, Brig.-Gen. Texas Chukwu, as alleged by an online publication. Usman proceeded to NIPSS for the executive course in January 2018. Chukwu, who had been the spokesman of the army until now, is to proceed to the same institute for the same course with immediate effect. The Directorate of Army Public Relations said in the statement that its attention was drawn to the publication which alleged that ‘Army reportedly removes Texas Chukwu, re-appoints Usman’. “The directorate wishes to state categorically that the report is not only malicious but an attempt by the writer to tarnish the reputation of the senior officer which he has built over the years in the course of his career as well as misleading members of the public. “The write-up further alleged that his removal followed outcry from different quarters on his ‘inability’ to manage information on counter-insurgency campaign, which is completely untrue and unsubstantiated. “Consequently, the directorate wishes to state that the writer has only succeeded in exhibiting his ignorance or complete lack of knowledge about postings and appointments in the Nigerian Army,” it said. The directorate, therefore, called on the online medium to “advise the reporter to cultivate the habit of verifying facts as well as balancing his report before rushing to the press’’. “The medium is requested to tender an unreserved apology to the senior officer as well as the Directorate of Army Public Relations through the same medium within 24 hours or be ready to face legal action,’’ the statement said.
