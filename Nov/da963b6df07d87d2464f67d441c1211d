Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, in a statement, said the event being organised by the French government and a number of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), is dictated by the “simple idea that international cooperation is key to tackling global challenges and ensuring durable peace.” Adesina said the president would join the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres and other world leaders to discuss contributions towards global peace while underscoring the imperative of collective action.
