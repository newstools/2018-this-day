Chairman of the League Management Company (LMC), Shehu Dikko, has been named the Match Commissioner for the 2nd Leg finals of Africa’s most prestigious club competition, the CAF Champions League which holds this evening in Tunisia. Dikko, who is also the 2nd Vice President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) is already in Tunis for the second leg of the finals between Al Ahly Sporting Club of Egypt and Esperance Sporting de Tunis of Tunisia at the Stade Olympique de Rades. The Egyptian club holds a 3-1 advantage from the first leg played in Cairo. Only last week, the Nigerian football chief joined CAF Executive Committee members, management and the President of the South Africa’s Premier Soccer League (PSL) to develop a new calendar for the CAF club competitions for the 2019/20 season. That session held in Morocco. Dikko, who is a member of the CAF Organising Commitee for Inter-Clubs Competitions and Management of Clubs Licensing and also a Member of FIFA Football Stakeholders Committee is among the growing number of Nigerians playing influential roles and holding key committee positions in African and world football. This highlights the emerging recognition of Nigerian football administrators in key decision and policy formulation positions in continental and international football. Interestingly, another Nigerian, Dr. Christian Emeruwa, a FIFA accredited Security and Safety expert will take charge of security during the finals in Tunisia at 7pm today with Samson Adamu, the Director of Competitions at CAF
