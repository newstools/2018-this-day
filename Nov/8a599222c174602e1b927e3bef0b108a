Pesident Muhammadu Buhari has received an attestation certificate and confirmation of school certificate result from the West African Examination Council, his Special Adviser on Media Mr. Femi Adesina, has disclosed. In a Tweet on Friday from his verified Twitter handle @FemAdesina, the president’s spokesman taunted Buhari’s critics, asking what would be their next move following the presentation of an attestation certificate to the president by the examination body. The tweet read: “WAEC presents attestation certificate and confirmation of result to President Buhari. What will the naysayers do next?” The president, like he did in 2015, had failed to submit his academic credentials to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, insisting that his certificate is with the Secretary of Military Board. His failure to present his academic credentials had generated national debate with the opposition calling for his disqualification for lack of possession of minimum educational requirement for presidential contest.
