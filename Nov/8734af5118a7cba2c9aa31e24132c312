The Mountain of Fire Basketball Club, new entrant into the National Women’s Basketball League, created an upset yesterday as they defeated Nigeria Customs 58-57 in the opening match of the Final Six decided at the Sports Hall of the National Stadium Lagos. It was a tension soaked encounter in which the Customs ladies led for the better part of the duration but the MFM ladies took over when it mattered most to win with just one point margin. The victory was the third recorded by the team with a single point margin. Coach Aderemi  Adewunmi  was full of praises for the MFM players who were not given a chance to win any match in the Final Six series. “No one gave us a chance from Enugu where we emerge for the Final Six but I am proud of these girls because within a short time they have been able to prove that with hard work, many things can be achieved in sports,” the coach said. MFM defeated First Deepwater in the crucial final match in Enugu to qualify for the final phase of the competition in Lagos. The Group Managing Director of Zenith Bank, Peter Amangbo, said the outfit was proud of the Women’s Basketball league which has produced many national team players over the years. “Zenith Bank is proud of the results Nigeria has posted in continental and global events of the game over the years. The female national team won AfroBasket and also played in the quarterfinal of the World Cup. Most of the players are products of this competition and we expect that the success story will continue in the years ahead,” Amangbo said. The competition ends on Wednesday in Lagos.
