By Davidson Iriekpen Justice Mohammed Idris of the Federal High Court in Lagos has revoked the bail it granted a former Governor of Abia State, Mr. Orji Uzor Kalu, in 2007. The judge made the order following Kalu’s absence in court without permission from his alleged N7.65 billion fraud trial. Justice Idris ordered Kalu, who is believed to be in Germany for surgery, to surrender his travel documents to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) upon his return to Nigeria. Kalu was also ordered to surrender himself to the EFCC within 24 hours of his return, failure of which he would be arrested. Justice Idris held: “Due to the circumstances, I am constrained to revoke the bail granted to the first defendant (Kalu). “The first defendant is, however, permitted to continue with his medical treatment abroad unharassed by law enforcement agencies. “Upon the first defendant’s return to the country, he shall at the point of entry surrender his passport and other relevant documents to the EFCC. “He shall also submit himself to the EFCC within 24 hours of his return, failing which he shall be detained by the EFCC.” Details later…
