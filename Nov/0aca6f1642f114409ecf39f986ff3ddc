By Shola Oyeyipo in Abuja In his capacity as the Chairman of the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC), President Muhammadu Buhari has convened a meeting of Heads of State and Government of the LCBC scheduled to take place in Nâ€™Djamena, Chad, Thursday. According to the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Asesina, the one-day meeting is to review the security situation in the areas affected by Boko Haram insurgency and adopt measures to enhance the capacity of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) to meet the challenges of securing the areas. The presidents of the LCBC member countries of Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and the Central African Republic have been invited to attend the meeting. The President of Benin Republic, a troops-contributing country, has also been invited to attend. The MNJTF and the national operations of the affected countries have appreciably degraded the capacity of Boko Haram terrorists, although the insurgents still retain the capacity to attack isolated targets in desperate search for supplies.
