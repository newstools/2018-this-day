By Alex Enumah in Abuja A Federal High Court in Abuja Wednesday ordered Senator Eyinnanya Abaribe and two other sureties to the now at lage leader of the Indeginous People’s of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, to deposit a total sum of N300 million with the registrar of the court in lieu of the bail bond they entered for Kanu. The amount was ordered to be deposited within two months by the sureties who in six months would be expected to show cause while the order should not be made absolute. Abaribe, Tochukwu Uchendu and Emmanuel Shalom Ben, a Jewish priest, had stood surety for Kanu as part of conditions for his bail granted by Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja in April 28, 2017. Trouble however arose for Abaribe and others when Kanu’s whereabouts remain a mystery to them. The whereabouts of Kanu and his parents remain speculative since September 14, 2017 when soldiers of the Nigerian army invaded their native home in Umuahia, Abia State. Both counsel to the sureties and federal government have continued to trade blame regarding the disappearance of Kanu, with government saying he escaped from the country while the sureties claimed he was either killed or being held by the military. Consequently, the trial judge, Justice Nyako, ordered the sureties to produce Kanu or forfeit their bail bond. At the resumed trial, the judge, who was told by the sureties that the whereabouts of the IPOB leader still remains unknown to them, ordered the sureties to, in the interim, deposit the N300 million with the court in lieu of the bail condition they entered for the IPOB leader.
