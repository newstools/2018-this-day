River State Governor, Governor Nyesom Wike, has called for joint effort to stop impunity in Nigeria, saying the current situation in the country is worrisome. The governor who berated the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), for attempted blackmail, said he was not in any way excited  over the media trial the commission has continued to adopt. While calling on federal government to refrain from using EFCC as a tool to intimidate opposition, the governor said it was wrong for federal government to be supervising what states get from common pull when nobody does the same to government at the centre. “We are running a federal system of government, where all tiers of government, including the federal government, come to the pull to collect what is due for their respective states. It is therefore wrong for federal government to start supervising us when nobody is supervising it,” he stated.
