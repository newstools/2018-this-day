By Alex Enumah in Abuja President Mohammadu Buhari and his Liberian counterpart, President George Weah, will on Tuesday, November 6, 2018, receive an award of excellence on their hard stance and fight against corruption and pro-poor crusade in Africa. Buhari will also declare open the 9th annual conference organised by the Centre for Peace and Environmental Justice (CEPEJ) tagged Minna 2018 with the theme: ‘Good Governance and Security: Panacea for Sustainable Development in Africa’. Buhari is expected to be joined by other eminent Nigerians who will be gracing the occasion to give hope to the Nigerian nation through the dogged fight against corruption and the enthronement of good governance. The Etsu Nupe, Gen. Yahaya Abubakar (rtd), will be the royal father of the day, while the Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, is the chief host. The keynote address will be delivered by the Liberian Ambassador to Nigeria, Prof. AL-Hassan Conteh, while the lead paper will be delivered by the Director General of the National Orientation Agency (NOA), Dr Abari Garba. Equally, several academics, experts and civil society actors will deliver papers at the conference covering security, environmental issues and the promotion of the culture of peace and peace building in Nigeria and Africa. The conference is expected to examine the rising tide of violent conflicts in Africa and as a way to draw the attention of Nigerian citizens and politicians on the need for good governance and development. The multi stakeholders’ conference, which has so far held across Nigerian states and other African countries, will address a lot of the issues earlier raised with an expectation to finding solutions.
