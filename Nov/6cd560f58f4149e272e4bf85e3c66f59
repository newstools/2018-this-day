By Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano The Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has been invited to appear Friday before an ad hoc committee constituted by the state House of Assembly over videos allegedly showing him collecting bribe from some contractors. The state House of Assembly, under the leadership of Alhaji Kabiru Alhassan Rurum, constituted a committee on October 15 to establish the authenticity of the videos. An online medium, DAILY NIGERIAN, had on October 14 and 15 exclusively published two videos showing Ganduje receiving bribe in dollars. Consequently, the publisher/editor-in-chief of DAILY NIGERIAN, Jaafar Jaafar, testified before the committee on October 15 where he insisted that the videos were genuine, and expressed readiness to swear by the Quran to convince doubting Thomases. The three-paragraph letter sent to the governor titled ‘Invitation to respond to an allegation of bribery against H.E Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje’, requested the governor to appear Friday. The invitation letter that was signed by the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee, and Majority Leader of the 40-man Assembly, Alhaji Baffa Baba Dan’Agundi, further requested the governor to make available to it “a written, signed and dated statement by your excellency as part of the proceedings on or before Friday”. The latest development by the Assembly probe committee was coming on the heels of another video uploaded on YouTube by yet to be identified individual where the governor, dressed in black kaftan with a cap to match was seen collecting wads of dollars from unnamed contractors.
