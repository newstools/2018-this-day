Mr Tunji Olawuyi has described his victory in Saturday’s Ekiti/Isin/Oke-Ero and Irepodun federal constituency by-election in Kwara as a victory for the people of the state. Olawuyi said that the success was a sign of more victories to come for the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 general elections in Kwara. He said this while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday at Omu-Aran, Kwara, while reacting to the outcome of the poll. NAN reports that Olawuyi polled 21,236 to emerge winner, while his closest rival, Mr Saheed Alatise of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), scored 18,095. “This is a happy moment for me because we have been doing this for a long time. “When your time has come, no one can stop you but at the same time, I give glory to God, because it is the best time Allah has created for me. “My party believed in me to put me forward for the assignment and I thank God I have delivered,” he said. Olawuyi, who described his party as the best in Africa, said he was never scared of the opposition because he is a grassroots politician that is loved by his people. He said because of the fact that his people love him and follow him with passion, he will always defeat his opponents in a free and fair election. Olawuyi said the state government’s statement that the election was between the PDP and the security agencies was laughable because it was what they were used to. He said he was now sure of an APC victory in the state in the 2019 general elections because of the spirit the electorate have demonstrated. (NAN)
