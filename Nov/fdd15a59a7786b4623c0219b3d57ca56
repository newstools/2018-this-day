The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) House of Representatives candidate for the Idanre/Ifedore federal constituency in next yearâ€™s election, Honourable Kayode Akinmade, has promised to ensure that most of the unemployed youths in the constituency are given employment opportunities. Akinmade, a former Commissioner for Information in the state, stated this in an interview with newsmen in Akure, the state capital. While promising that youth employment would be one of his priorities as a federal lawmaker, Akinmade noted that parents of the unemployed youths had spent their hard-earned money to train them in various fields of human endeavors in the hope that they would not only be useful to themselves but also to the society, adding that this hope must not be dashed. According to him, some of the unemployed youths left the university with first class and second class upper degrees but unfortunately, because of unemployment and unavailability of a helping hand, resorted to riding motorbikes and doing menial jobs for a living. This, he said, was unacceptable. According to him, the future of the constituency lies in the hands of the youths and for the community to make progress, the youths must be gainfully engaged.
