Leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and their supporters had a good time, feasting on the Dubai retreat trip by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate and his team, even though their obsession ironically gave them away as jittery. In fact, a former governor of Lagos State and one of the national leaders of the party, Bola Tinubu came out disappointingly to say even if Atiku chose to strategise in the jungle, he would be defeated in 2019 by their own candidate and incumbent president, Muhammadu Buhari. Unfortunately, that too sounded defeatist and failed to show an intelligent commentary on the part of the political leadership. Ironically, Tinubu and co had forgotten that in 2015, they spent a lot of times in London, not just to strategise, but also to raise funds, a decision nobody condemned at the time. There is absolutely nothing to the Atiku Dubai trip except that it exposes the lack of capacity on the part of the ruling party to constructively engage opposition parties. The APC is therefore beginning to give itself away as simply waiting to fulfill the ‘defeat prophecy’ coming from different quarters. The fixation on Atiku is a cheap distraction that has no substance to it or adds any value to where they current stand. They should be worried because they have more to lose.
