The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Kwara, Garba Madami, has described the Ekiti/Isin/Oke-Ero and Irepodun federal constituency bye-election as peaceful. Madami said this on Saturday in Omu-Aran, the headquarters of Irepodun Local Government area of the state while speaking with newsmen. He said Nigerians should emulate the people of the constituency because of the way they conducted themselves for the election on Saturday. “I am very happy with the turnout of voters and the peaceful way the people here have conducted themselves. “This is how election should be. This is the spirit of election and I want Kwarans to keep this up and Nigerians should emulate them,” Madami said. He said the reports he had received were positive if not for some places where there were card reader hitches which were resolved in due course. Despite rumours in some quarters of vote buying, Madami denied there was anything like that. In any case, he said he had not received any news of such. He urged Nigerians with defaced cards to approach his office for a replacement as they may have problems voting. Madami called on those who are yet to collect their Permanent Voters Card to come for them as they have until first week of February to collect them. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that the by-election became necessary after the death of incumbent Ms. Funke Adedoyin, on Friday, Sept. 28, in Abuja.(NAN)
