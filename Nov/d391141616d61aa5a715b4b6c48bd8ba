Demola Ojo South African Tourism has revealed a new Regional Head for West Africa. Thekiso Rakolojane has been appointed to take over from Hloni Pitso, who has over the past five years, successfully marketed South Africa to Nigeria, Ghana and other parts of the sub-region from its Lagos office. Rakolojane has over 17 years experience in the fields of marketing and communications and has spent the better part of the last decade as Marketing and Communications Manager of the Tourism Grading Council of South Africa (TGCSA), a business unit of South African Tourism.
Rakolojane was introduced to SA Tourism’s travel, trade and media partners as well as other stakeholders by the organisation’s Chief Operating Officer, Sthembiso Dlamini, at an intimate dinner at Shiro restaurant, Lagos, last week. Dlamini used the opportunity to pay glowing tributes to the outgoing Regional Head. According to her, Pitso – the pioneer head of SA Tourism’s West Africa office – exceeded expectations during his tenure, with tangible growth in tourist arrivals to South Africa from West Africa, as well as deepening the relationship between the two regions.
Pitso’s remarkable work in West Africa has earned him a transfer to head SA Tourism’s South Europe Region, comprising France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, with the expectation that he would grow that market just as he grew West Africa. A notable presence at the event was South Africa’s Consul General to Nigeria, Darkey Africa, who promised a more favourable visa regime for Nigerian travellers to South Africa, especially those travelling for business and tourism purposes.
