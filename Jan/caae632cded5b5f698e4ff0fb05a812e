 Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja Members of the rebellious Fresh Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Sunday ended their standoff with the party and vowed to work with the Prince Uche Secondus leadership. Members of the group, led by Chief Olukayode Akindele, who declared that the party is one and united entity, also cancelled their earlier plan to inaugurate a parallel National Working Committee (NWC) on Monday, January 22. The declaration was made after a truce was reached at the residence of a former national chairman of PDP, Dr Okwesilieze Nwodo, in Abuja. Besides Nwodo, other members of the PDP present at the peace meeting were a member of the party’s Board of Trustees (BoT), Senator Stella Omu, and the National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Kola Ologbodiyan. Those who represented the Fresh PDP were Akindele, Godwin Duru who contested for the office of national organising secretary of the party at the convention, and Franklyne Edede, who ran for the office of national youth leader also at the last convention. The Fresh PDP had last year opened their parallel secretariat of PDP in protest to the outcome of the December 9 national convention of the party. They had early this year declared plans to inaugurate their parallel NWC members on Monday, January 22 in Abuja. Details later…
