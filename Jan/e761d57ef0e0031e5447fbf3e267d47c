Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja South Korea will next month donate the Korea/Nigeria Model School built at the cost of $15 million to the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA). The FCTA Education Secretary, Senator Isa Maina, who disclosed this recently at the opening ceremony of a seven-day training for 150 teachers and administrators to run the school built in partnership with the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), lauded the school’s standard. He said only few schools if any, can match the Nigeria/Korea Model School in concept, design and construction as the quality of work is outstanding. He urged all beneficiaries of the training and other stakeholders to take their responsibilities to the operation and maintenance of the school with utmost seriousness and professionalism, saying that South Korea is one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world. “Your training is very important because you are going to form an elite crop of teachers. You are hereby called to live up to your calling as imparters of knowledge and moulders of young minds. This fourth level training will further enhance and broaden your scope of knowledge and I urge you not to misuse this opportunity and even use it as a foundation for personal improvement.” Maina who was represented by the Director, Administration and Finance, Mrs. Eunice Ugochukwu, said the FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello has taken a personal interest in the school having visited it even during construction, adding that the minister has set up a committee, chaired by the FCTA Permanent Secretary, Christian Ohaa and supervised by the education secretary to maintain the aesthetics and academic integrity of the school for the foreseeable future. The school, which will be handed over by the Korean government to the FCTA, will commence operation in September.
