Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja The former Speaker of House of Representative, Hon. Dimeji Bankole, has joined the newly registered Action Democratic Party (ADP). The former Speaker was listed as member of the newly inaugurated contact and mobilisation committee ahead of the party for the 2019 general election. Until his move to ADP, Bankole was a staunch member of the PDP. Dimeji’s father, who is also the chairman Board of Trustees (BoT) of the party, Chief Alani Bankole, also confirmed in an interview with journalists yesterday that his son is now a chieftain of the opposition ADP. The 32-member committee headed by Senator Roland Owei, has Senator Isa Ndako, Senator Chris Ukpabi, Ambassador Mathew Adoli, Gen. Muhammed Gana and Hajia Hadisa Muhammed as members. Speaking during the inauguration yesterday in Abuja, the National Chairman of the party Mr. Yabaji Sani, said the committee was put together “to serve as vehicle to reach the unreached or reluctant to embark on decisive measures to rescue Nigeria. “Our economy is in the doldrums, education has virtually collapsed, insecurity has become pervasive with several of our country men and women, mowed down daily by criminal elements. “Obviously, we cannot keep silent in the face of evil and daunting challenges. ADP has stepped in to change the narrative. We are determined to rebuild Nigeria into an egalitarian nation where tribe and religion will never be factors that determine a citizen level of attainment.” Responding, the Chairman of the committee, Owie, said the panel was in accordance with the genuine move of the party to raise up a new generation of party faithful and Nigerians for the party to rescue the country from what he described as avoidable hardship.
