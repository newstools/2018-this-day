Be rest assured and I assure all public servants, especially those that work for the federal government that their salaries will be paid immediately,” he said. On the Paris Club withdrawal, the Permanent Secretary, Isa-Dutse said: “Paris Club refund is not really a FAAC matter. FAAC meets to review revenue collection in the Federation Account and agree on the distribution. “The issue of Paris Club refund is a technical matter and we did not discuss it at all at this meeting. So what I think is that you should direct the question to the agency of government and you will get the correct answer. I don’t want to mislead you,” he said.
