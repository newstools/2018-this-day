Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja Following reports that a former governor of Kano State, Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau, has defected from the Peoples Democratic Party, the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party has taken steps to halt his exit. In a statement on Tuesday, the party announced it had resolved to expand the Kano State Caretaker Committee to accommodate all interests in line with its adherence to the principles of all-inclusiveness. The party leadership also said it was prepared to engage with all stakeholders in Kano provided all matters in court against the party are withdrawn and all members work together to build a united PDP that would confront and send incompetent and insensitive people out of governance in Kano State and Nigeria at large. The statement signed by the National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said the party was also open to opinions and suggestions from stakeholders in ensuring reconciliation and accommodation of all interests within its fold in the state. Ologbondiyan stressed that, “the NWC assures that no stone will be left unturned in the overall quest to bring good governance to Kano State, while putting in place machinery to hedge the infiltration of fifth columnists in the party’s fold in the state. “Furthermore, the NWC urges all stakeholders to always emulate our members in Benue State in the way and manner they united to resolve all issues concerning party structures of their state.”
