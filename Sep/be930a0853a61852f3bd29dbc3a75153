Chinedu Eze A car engulfed by fire at the open park, less than 200 meters to the international terminal of the Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA), Lagos sparked panic among travellers and airport users, Saturday evening. The fear of a burning car, unattended with thick, black smoke billowing into air, forced motorists to scamper for safety and caused heavy gridlock on the Oshodi-Airport Road vehicular traffic. Eye witness account said the car suddenly went up in flames and continued to burn for several minutes without fire fighters in sight. Other people who parked their vehicles at the car park were alerted and the scrambled to move their vehicles, thus exacerbating the panic and chaos. The eye witness said after the car had burnt to its carcass, frantic effort was made by the airport authorities to put out the fire. “There has been a severe gridlock into and out of the airport at the moment as the traffic appears to be extending to Oshodi at the moment. When the incident happened, there were no fire fighters to quickly put off the fire. As I am speaking to you, efforts are being made to bring in fire fighters; but they are yet to arrive,” an intending traveller told newsmen. The open car park is located opposite the Catholic Church and the Mosque, few meters to the multi-story car park, near the new international terminal of the Lagos airport.
