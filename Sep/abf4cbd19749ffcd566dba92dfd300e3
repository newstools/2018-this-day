By David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka Unknown gunmen Thursday evening trailed and shot a popular cleric, Pastor David Elijah Chidiebere, in front of his church in Awka, Anambra State. The middle aged pastor who is the founder of Divine Prophetic Ministry, is known for his very intriguing prophesies and healing miracles in the city. Though it was not clear if the cleric was attacked by assasins or armed robbers, THISDAY gathered that the gunmen trailed him in their vehicle from Enugu to Awka where he was attacked when he wanted to park his car in front of his church. An unidentified source from his church was quoted as saying the suspects demanded to be given N5million, but he offered them N1million which they declined. Another account however stated that the gunmen after spraying his vehicle with bullets, left him in the pool of his blood and carted away an undisclosed sum. Pastor Chidiebere was rescued by some members of his church after the gunmen drove away, and was said to be receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital. When THISDAY visited the church premises, some members of his church were seen discussing the attack in clusters. A resident, who gave his name as Johnson, said he was passing through that road when he saw some persons pulling out a man from the bullet riddled vehicle. “When I enquired, I was told that he was the pastor of the church. Who knows what he must have done to attract this kind of treatment?” he wondered. Haruna Mohammed, Anambra State Police spokesperson, could not confirm the attack. He promised to get back to our correspondent after enquiring from the DPO in charge of the area but had yet to do that at the time of filing this report. The incident happened less than 500 meters from B division, police station.
