Lagos State Governor Akinwumi Ambode has said that his main challenger in Monday’s governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress, Jide Sanwo-Olu, is unfit to be governor. Sanwo-Olu enjoys the support of the leadership of the APC in the state, including its national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. At what was tagged a ‘World Press Conference’ on Sunday, Governor Ambode alleged that Sanwo-Olu was once arrested in the United States for spending fake dollars in a night club. “He has been arrested for spending fake US dollars in an American night club. He lacks competency and health-wise, he has gone through mental rehabilitation,” Ambode alleged. He further alleged that Sanwo-Olu served time in US prisons in connection with a string of counterfeit bill-passing incidents. While assuring party members that government would ensure adequate security during Monday’s primary, the governor said he was under no illusion about the battle for the APC governorship ticket, but added: ”We shall overcome.” Details later….
