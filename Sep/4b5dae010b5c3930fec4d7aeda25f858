James Sowole in Akure The Pan Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere yesterday declared that it has not endorsed any presidential aspirant for the 2019 general elections. The declaration was made by the National Leader of Afenifere, Pa Reuben Fasoranti at his residence in Akure, the Ondo state capital while receiving a PDP presidential aspirant, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. Fasoranti, who spoke through the group’s Secretary General, Chief Sehinde Arogbofa, noted that all presidential aspirants would be examined by the group and other elders’ groups in the country. He said the group cannot endorse aspirant but will work with a candidate that can meet the philosophies of Afenifere, especially the agitation for the country’s restructuring. Fasoranti, who spoke with journalists, said Afenifere would make its position on 2019 polls known to Nigerians after political parties’ primaries. “It makes no sense to suggest that a serious group would adopt an aspirant when political parties are yet to produce candidates. “We must state emphatically that our preoccupation at the moment is to engage presidential aspirants vis-a-vis our conviction that for Nigeria to make progress,It must be restructured into a truly federal polity . “It is when political parties have put forward their candidates that Afenifere and its partners across Nigeria in the Nigerian leaders and elders forum would make a choice of a candidate whose vision and commitment tally with our quest for a productive and working Nigeria . “We are fully committed to the goal of saving Nigeria from collapse and putting in place a leadership that can kick-start the rebuilding of our country to make it take its pride of place in the comity of nations as well as providing opportunities for millions of our young people wasting away at home and perishing in the deserts in search of elusive greener pasture in spite of our having all that is needed to give them chances in life at home”, he said.
