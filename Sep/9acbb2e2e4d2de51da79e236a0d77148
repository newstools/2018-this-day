Other people will come and ask you for the same favour but that should stop you from choosing the best, credible, and the most committed party man that will win in the general polls.’’ Bala Tinka is the Managing Director of the Tinka Point Limited and he was the convener of the ‘’Talba Neighbor 2 Neighbor’’ a group he formed to support Dankwambo in the 2015 general election.
