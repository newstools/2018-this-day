Pete Sharland Roger Federer defeated Nick Kyrgios 6-4, 6-1 7-5 in the third round of the US Open yesterday. The blockbuster clash of the day, Federer and Kyrgios didn’t disappoint even if the latter played it true to form. In the first set, Kyrgios kept pace with Federer, even imitating his opponent’s serve at one point, but he totally fell apart in the second. Nothing was coming off and the Australian was having repeated arguments with his box and was clearly struggling with his first serve. Federer, perhaps riled by that earlier imitation, was in no mood to let up and raced into a 5-0 lead before comfortably finishing off the set. Federer produced the shot of the match, and possibly the tournament, when he somehow scrambled all the way across court to make a Kyrgios drop. Once there he directed it around the net when it looked as if he had no angle, leaving Kyrgios stunned.
