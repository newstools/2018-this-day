Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr and captain John Obi Mikel snubbed Cristiano Ronaldo and Mohamed Salah to cast their votes for eventual Best FIFA Men’s Player 2018 winner Luka Modric. The Croatia midfielder claimed the prize at the awards gala held in London on Monday evening, edging his former Real Madrid teammate and holder Ronaldo and Liverpool’s Salah who ended second and third respectively. FIFA released a list of the players each voter chose for the top individual gong in football which consisted of national team captains, national team coaches and a journalist from every territory that fields a side on the international level. Rohr, as Nigeria coach, selected Modric – who scored in Croatia’s 2-0 win over the Super Eagles in their group opening game at this summer’s World Cup – in first place, Eden Hazard in second and France posterboy Kylian Mbappe in third. As captain of the three-time African champions, Mikel continued with Lionel Messi in first place – after doing similar at the last awards, with Mbappe and Modric in second and third place. Both Nigerian delegates ditched the holder of the award, Ronaldo and Egypt superstar Salah who netted 44 goals in his debut season at Liverpool and helped his country qualify for the World Cup after a 28-year absence.
