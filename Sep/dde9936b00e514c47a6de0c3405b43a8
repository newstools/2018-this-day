Nigeria lost 23-25, 22-25 and 22-25 and faces a must-win match today against Tunisia to stand a chance of advancing from Group A. Rwanda rebounded by beating Nigeria following their 3-0 loss to Tunisia on Wednesday. Eight countries are attending the tournament in Abuja to decide Africa’s representatives to the FIVB U-21 Volleyball Championship to hold in Bahrain next year.
