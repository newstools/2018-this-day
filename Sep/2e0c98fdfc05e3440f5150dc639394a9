Emmanuel Ukumba in Lafia The National Secretary of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Mr. Labaran Maku, has obtained the nomination form to contest for the governorship ticket on the platform of his party in Nasarawa State. Maku, a former Minister of Information, contested for the governorship seat of the state during the 2015 general elections on the platform of APGA but lost to the incumbent Governor, UmaruTanko Al-Makura. Announcing Maku’s ambition at a press briefing yesterday in Lafia, the Director-General of Labaran Maku Campaign Organisation, Dr. Nawani Aboki, said Maku was set for the journey of the 2019 election. Aboki said: “I want to formally inform you that Labaran Maku is set for the journey of the 2019 election. The forms have been purchased and duly filled. By next week, there will be presentation of the nomination form to the national headquarters of APGA.” “I want to also say that there has been no secret or open meetings between PDP and APGA anywhere in Nasarawa State or outside the state that there was any agreement that Maku will step down for anybody.APGA has the best product in the market to sell to the people of Nasarawa State. A good product cannot step down for a bad product. “So we want to state here that no agreement has been made that Maku should step down for anybody in PDP. Today, Maku remains the best thing that can happen to Nasarawa State. We are therefore calling on the people of Nasarawa State to disregard any rumour in this regard. Rather, they should work with Maku to ensure that we put a government that cares for the people of this state.”
