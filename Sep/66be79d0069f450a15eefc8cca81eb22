The Golden Eaglets will hope to avenge their elimination from the 2017 Under-17 AFCON when they face hosts Niger in the semi-final of the zonal 2019 Under-17 AFCON qualifier tonight. The grudge match will kick off by 7.30 pm this evening at the Seyni Kountche Stadium in Niamey. Niger shocked the more illustrious Eaglets to qualify for the 2017 Under-17 AFCON in Rwanda. Nigeria’s Assistant Coach Nduka Ugbade said: “We were beaten by Niger two years ago but we will not allow that to happen again. We are going to do battle against them again no matter the situation.” Today’s match is one between the solid defence of Niger, who have yet to concede a goal thus far, and the rampant Eaglets attack, who have netted seven goals. The first semi-final will be between Group A winners Ghana against Cote d’Ivoire, who fought back from a 5-1 loss to Nigeria to beat Burkina Faso 3-0. The game will kick off 4.30pm at the same venue.
