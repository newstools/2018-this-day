Goddy Egene The Nigerian equities market slumped to 15-month low yesterday on continuing bear run with the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index (NSE ASI) falling 1.25 per cent to close at 33,611.69, while market capitalisation shed N155.6 billion to close at N12.27 trillion. The market had lost 2.3 per cent last week in line with the persistent bearish trend. Although some analysts had said the current trend was not necessarily a true reflection of the fundamentals of companies, adding that opportunities still remain in the market. However, investors appear not to be taking advantage of those opportunities, hence the persistent slide in the market, which has worsened the year-to-date decline to 12.1 per cent. Some market analysts said investors should trade cautiously in the short to medium term, as selloffs are likely to persist, amidst the brewing political uncertainty, and the absence of a one-off positive trigger. “However, stable macroeconomic fundamentals remain supportive of long term gains,” they said. Others noted that they envisage a negative close to the market this week due to continued sell offs, in the absence of any significant market information to sway the market the other way. In all, 21 stocks depreciated compared with 11 others that depreciated.
