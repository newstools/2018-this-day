The case, which was reported this September, was said to have occurred on August 13 this year, when the survivor’s mother left her child in the care of her landlady, to quickly attend to an errand. According to the mother, she later discovered that her daughter was in pains when she tried to bathe her the next day., The Child Protection Network (CPN) Coordinator for Isolo-Shomolu, Mr. Ebenezer Omejalile, said the perpetrator, Akinsasu, is presently at large, adding that although the suspect’s family has been threatening the survivor’s family, justice must be served. Omejalile further said the little girl had been taken to Mirabel Centre, where the medical test showed that the perpetrator sexually abused her through both her vagina and anus.
