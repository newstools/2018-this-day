From Udora Orizu in Abuja A newly registered political party, Advanced Allied Party (AAP) has welcomed Comrade Chike Ukaegbu, who declared his interest to run for the office of the President of Nigeria in 2019 on the platform of the party. Speaking at the declaration event in Abuja, Ukaegbu thanked the party for giving him the political platform to realise his ambition of rescuing Nigeria from the clutch of poverty and underdevelopment due to years of absence of visionary leadership. “AAP is a party that’s is citizens oriented and masses-conscious, selflessly committed to national prosperity and better life for Nigerians all over the globe and even foreigners dwelling in Nigerian soil, irrespective of ethnic group, religious background or political affiliation,” Ukaegbu said. He stressed that the party would radically bridge the huge gap in the standard of living between the rich and the poor, through a very strong and cost effective governance mechanism hinged around indigenous social-capitalist economy and true federalism. In the same vein, the party’s national chairman, represented by Paul Iyemike, said the party was impressed by the aspirant, adding his preparedness to unseat President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019, did not come as a surprise. The chairman added that Ukaegbu’s interest aligned with the objectives of youth, students and other Nigerians to participate in political leadership of the country. He assured the aspirant that the party will mobilise its existing political structures nationwide to organise a transparent primary election and ensure its candidates emerge victorious in the 2019 elections. Iyemike further said that the party wants to address injustice and decadence in the society and will be open and fair to everyone. The party’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Comrade Rikki Nwajiofor, enjoined Nigerian youths to embrace politics with spirit of patriotism, devoid of rancour and thuggery.
