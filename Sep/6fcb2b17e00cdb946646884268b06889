Senegal’s Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah of Egypt are the only Africans on the 55-man shortlist for the Fifpro World XI. England’s Kyle Walker, Kieran Trippier and Harry Kane are also named on the long list alongside seven members of France’s World Cup-winning team. Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk and Dejan Lovren were also included for the first time. Wales’ Gareth Bale misses out, and there also no Scottish or Northern Irish players on the list. The list was compiled from the votes of 25,000 footballers from 65 countries. Players were asked to pick one goalkeeper, four defenders, three midfielders and three attackers who excelled in the 2017-18 season. Tottenham striker Kane won the Golden Boot as leading scorer as England reached the World Cup semi-finals. The French World Cup winners are Antoine Griezmann, N’Golo Kante, Kylian Mbappe, Benjamin Pavard, Paul Pogba, Samuel Umtiti and Raphael Varane. Real Madrid’s entire starting XI from their Champions League win against Liverpool in May made the list, including Cristiano Ronaldo, who joined Juventus in the summer, while new goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who signed from Chelsea, is also included. But Bale, who scored twice for Real in the final, did not make the cut. Premier League champions Manchester City have three players included in David Silva, Kevin de Bruyne and Walker. Manchester United have Pogba, David de Gea, Nemanja Matic and Romelu Lukaku, while Everton’s new Colombian centre-back Yerry Mina is among the 55 names. The final XI will be revealed during the Best FIFA Football Awards in London on 24 September.
