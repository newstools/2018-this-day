By Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti In what could be described as divided loyalty to the strike declared by labour to press for a new national minimum wage, some workers in Ekiti State civil service reported for work on Thursday. Labour, through the National President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Com. Ayuba Wabba, on Wednesday directed all labour centres across the 36 states of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory to begin a nationwide warning strike today (Thursday). The strike began midnight Wednesday. When our correspondent visited the old Governor’s Office and the new Secretariat along Old Iyin Road at about 9.30am, some workers had reported at their duty posts while some were absent. The commercial motorcycle riders, commercial drivers as well as banks were also opened for business transactions in spite of the directive that there should be a total shut down of the country. Drivers and motorbike operators were seen plying major roads of Ado Ekiti in large numbers. The popular Erekesan market and shops located along Basiri-Ajilosun areas and other commercial nerve centres of Ado Ekiti were operating full-fledged businesses contrary to expectations of the people. Virtually all the private schools also opened for operation as their vehicles were seen conveying pupils as early as 6.30am. When asked why he decided to report to work, a worker told our correspondent that he did so because of the fear that other workers might not be enthusiastic to join the industrial action in Ekiti, since the state government could not even pay up to date even with the present N18,000 minimum salary scale . The NLC Chairman in Ekiti, Com. Ade Adesanmi, and that of TUC, Com. Odunayo Adesoye, on Wednesday directed that all public and private business centres should join the strike. Details later…
