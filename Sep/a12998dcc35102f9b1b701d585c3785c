By David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka The Nigeria Society of Engineers (NSE) has called for transparent procurement process as one of the ways of curbing corruption in the country. The group stated this during the maiden edition of Emeka Ezeh Annual Public Lecture in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the society which held at the weekend in Awka, Anambra State. Chris Okoye who delivered the lecture with the theme, “A Case for Good Governance: Role of the Procurement Process,” said that good governance could only be sustained in an atmosphere where strong institutions thrive. The renowned civil engineer said that transparent procurement process would not only fight corruption, but also ensure good governance in the country. Okoye said, “Three drivers of good governance include due process, outcome and impact of the outcome. It is important that we adhere strictly to due process. “The linkage between good governance and sustainable development cannot be over emphasised.” Anambra State Governor, Chief Willie Obiano, who was represented at the function by his deputy, Dr. Nkem Okeke, said the state government was working to eliminate wasteful spending through prioritisation of the needs of the people. The governor said it is doing so, using transparent procurement process, and that when the practice is gotten right, good governance would automatically have been enthroned. Okeke said the Obiano administration had demonstrated commitment to transparent procurement process through the institution of the Tender’s Board to eliminate waste. Okeke while delivering the keynote address insisted that societies that were not striving for good governance were doomed. The event featured presentation of awards to the Deputy Governor, Ezeh and other distinguished members of the organisation while over 40 new members were inducted into the society.
