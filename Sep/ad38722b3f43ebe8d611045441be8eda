Onyebuchi Ezigbo The Organised labour was Thursday summoned to a meeting by the presidency in a bid to halt the ongoing nationwide industrial action which began Thursday. The Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, was said to have met with labour leaders behind closed-doors but nothing significant resulted from the meeting. Speaking with THISDAY on telephone shortly after the meeting, the NLC General Secretary, Peter Esom, said that the industrial action will continue as nothing new came out of the discussion. “We’ve just finished a meeting with the Chief of Staff to the President and we say there is no anything different. The strike continues tomorrow until further notice,” he said.
