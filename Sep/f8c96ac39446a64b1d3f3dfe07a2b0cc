Come October 6, 2018, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome of Believer’s LoveWorld Incorporated, aka Christ Embassy, will give the hand of his beautiful daughter, Sharon Carrisa, in marriage to her sweetheart, Phillip Frimpong, at the Loveworld Convocation, Oregun, Ikeja, Lagos. It was gathered that a 400-man choir is billed to perform at the ceremony. Both the stupendously rich pastor and his Nigerian-Swiss wife/ex-wife, Anita, are leaving no stone unturned to make the day most memorable for their daughter. The joyful mum broke the news with pictures on the social media, where her pretty and adorable Sharon holds a bouquet beside the love of her life during a photo shoot sometime in 2017. She wrote: “Congratulations to my daughter and son-in-law-to-be. What makes marriage beautiful is when two become one flesh, inseparable and always enjoying the pleasure of each other’s company.” It will be recalled that Sharon, who dropped her debut single, “ I’m Excellent in 2014, took to her Facebook page in October to announce her engagement to her Ghanaian lover and the co-founder of ONUA, a fast-growing online advertising company that promotes West African artistry.
