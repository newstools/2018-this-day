By Seriki Adinoyi in Jos ‎Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State has said that the signing of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law 2018 was good, as it has put an end to the transfer of suspects from the state to Abuja, adding that it has reinforced the framework for the effective prosecution of criminal cases in the state. The governor stated this during the signing into law three bills on Tuesday at the Government House, Rayfield, Jos. According to the governor, “With the signing of the laws, the people are assured of the quick dispensation of justice.” Lalong lauded the synergy between the three arms of government in the state, which has resulted in the signing of the three laws: Plateau State Information and Communication Technology Development Agency Law, 2017, Penal Code of Plateau State 2018, and Plateau State Administration of Criminal Justice Law 2018. The governor was accompanied by Hon Joshua Madaki, Speaker, Plateau State House of Assembly, and Yakubu Dakwak, Chief Judge of Plateau State.
