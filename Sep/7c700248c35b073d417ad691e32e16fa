Leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) recently challenged the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and President Muhammadu Buhari to a public debate on good governance ahead of the 2019 elections. In its response, the APC described the challenge as incredible and laughable. And that was it. Really? In the lead up to the 2015 elections, recall that even as clueless as former President Goodluck Jonathan was painted, he longed for a debate with Buhari on some of the issues that defined that election, a challenge that Buhari and his handlers tactically avoided, because clearly, he did not understand the issues, and as such, could not sell them. Truth is that there cannot be any decent election with informed choices without a debate. Buhari and his party cannot run away from the issues that confront the nation. Nigeria will like a debate on everything – security, economy and corruption – including Buhari’s recent vetoing of the Electoral Act amendment bill and the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill (PIGB). Indeed, the electorate would like a debate on his style of leadership. It won’t be business as usual, certainly!
