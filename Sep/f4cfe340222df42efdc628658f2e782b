Amby Uneze in Owerri A High Court sitting in Owerri in Imo State yesterday nullified the removal of the State Deputy Governor, Prince Eze Madumere by the House of Assembly, declaring such move “as invalid and of no legal effect”. The presiding judge, Justice Benjamin Iheaka who annulled the purported removal, lambasted the State Chief Judge, Justice Paschal Nnadi and the Attorney General of the state, Militus Nlemadim for not adhering to the provisions of section 188 sub-section 5 of the1999 constitution as amended in the removal of Madumere. Madumere was purportedly removed on July 30 by a section of the Imo State House of Assembly following a motion moved by the member representing Owerri Munisipal, Hon. Lugard Osuji.
The deputy governor was accused of abandoning his duty for three months and failure to carry out his constitutional duties among others. He was said to have signified interest to run for the governorship of the state, a decision, which many believed was the cause of his rift with Governor Rochas Okorocha for not supporting his (Governor’s) son-in-law, Uche Nwosu in his effort to install him as his successor. The presiding judge ruled that the Chief Judge of the state failed to set up the required seven-man panel of equiry to investigate the allegations levelled by the House of Assembly against the deputy governor.
Madumere who was full of joy expressed gratitude to the judiciary describing it as the last hope of the oppressed in the society. However, government indicates interest to appeal the judgment.
