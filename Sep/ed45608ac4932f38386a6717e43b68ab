By Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, Friday evening said that the party was still expecting the result of the presidential primary held on Friday to elect its presidential candidate. Speaking on the Friday’s presidential primary held across the country, Oshiomhole who addressed journalists in Abuja said the party was in the process of collating the results of the exercise and will make it public as soon they were ready. “The process entails collating the results from ward levels to local council and then state level, to know how many persons participated in the primary election. These are well thought out ideas meant to return the country to democratic ideals,” he said. When asked to say the population of members of party and the percentage that participated in the presidential primary, Oshiomhole said that although the APC boasts 16 million members, he could not say the actual number that voted at the primary until results were collated.
