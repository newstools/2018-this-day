Premium cognac brand, Martell, and urban lifestyle brand, 24 Apparel, have released a second collection of limited edition Snapbacks for cognac and fashion lovers. In one of the trendiest brand partnerships, following from last year’s collaboration, the two brands came together recently to whet the appetite of brandy lovers and fashionistas. The new collection was unveiled to guests at a laid back event, which was attended by Denola Grey, Nonso Bassey, Sammy Walsh, and Bollylomo as they enjoyed Martell cocktails and music by DJ Sparrow. Martell brought 24 Apparel on board to design an exclusive range of Snapbacks, which will be gifted with every purchase of The Martell Blue Swift, in line with the spirit of generosity championed by the Cognac brand. The limited edition piece, which is made out of brushed cotton, features the Martell Swift on a gold plated badge set in the middle of the dome area, a velvet accent on the peak of the Snapback adds a luxury touch as the Martell and 24 Signature Logos, perfectly placed on the side adds the finishing touches to this collector’s item. The limited edition piece, which reinforces the brand’s cool factor, is currently available in the ‘Martell Blue’, with a classic Black range set to be released in the coming weeks.
