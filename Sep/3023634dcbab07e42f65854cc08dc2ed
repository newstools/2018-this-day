By Seriki Adinoyi in Jos The entire city of Jos, Plateau State capital, was Friday morning thrown into pandemonium as residents closed shops and scampered for safety from their work places. The development followed the killing of 11 persons at Rukuba road by unknown gunmen. The assailants reportedly attacked the home of a famous woman in the area called Mama-Kogi at about 9 pm on Thursday, killing her and members of her family including Blessing, Ruth, Jonathan, Cynthia and Majesty. Others in the neighbourhood were also killed in the attack. The development degenerated into violence in the area, and escalated to Gada-biu, where two other persons were killed, and Akpata, where another person was also killed, and indeed other parts of the city. Security personnel have showed up in the affected areas battling to quell the violence. There is however palpable tension and fears that there might be resurgence of the violence after the Juma’at prayers. The spokesman of the Military Special Task Force (STF) said he will issue a statement on the incident. There are speculations that more persons may have been killed in the violence. Details later….
