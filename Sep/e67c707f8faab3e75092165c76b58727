By Ayodeji Ake To mark the 58th Independence anniversary, the Spirit Of David (SOD) dance club, in collaboration with the Society for The Performing Arts in Nigeria (SPAN), has announced its annual dance show with the theme ‘What If.‘ Addressing journalist in Lagos recently, the chairperson of SOD, Yinka Aworetan, said the show would be held in Eko Hotel, Lagos on October 1. Explaining the theme of the show, she said it’s a story about choice, imagination and a look at where our choices take us. “The aim of this event is to appreciate the daily power of choice and the quest to live a life in the centre of God’s will for us. It’s a movement that will inspire Lagos, Nigeria and the world to think through the seemingly mundane choices that often have an impact on our lives,” she said. Speaking on why the show has been designed for Independence Day, Aworetan said “SOD has upheld the mandate of spreading inspiring messages with timely themes of peace, freedom and new beginnings, every October 1st to commemorate the Independence Day.” The partners and networking officer, SOD, Nwando Lawal, noted that the club was charged with the obligation of preaching the gospel through dance. “We dance to preach the spirit of the gospel. So far, we have about 400 members and this show will be the 97th show we will be organising. It is for the youths, we try to communicate through dancing, we challenge people to change positively through dance. Founder, SPAN, Sarah Boulos, said the organisation was aimed to set a world class standard for performing arts education in Nigeria, and to offer unprecedented opportunities in dance, music, theatre and visual arts to Nigeria’s talented citizens. Boulos added that SPAN offers both formal and informal classes in professional theatre, music and dance in Nigeria and empowers artists and personnel with art management seminars and classes.
