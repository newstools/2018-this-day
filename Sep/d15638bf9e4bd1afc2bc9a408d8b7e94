Ahead of the Osun rerun governorship election, a confident Senator Iyiola Omisore said his Social Democratic Party and the ruling All Progressives Congress will form a coalition to govern the state after the election. Omisore announced this in Ile-Ife Wednesday in an interview with journalists. It was the first time he was giving a hint into the electoral arrangement with the APC. “We have accepted to support the APC for victory in the rerun election tomorrow and thereafter form a coalition government,” he said. The announcement formally shut the doors of collaboration with the Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Ademola Adeleke. Omisore dumped the PDP after high level talks with the leaders of the APC in Ile-Ife. The APC delegation comprised the party chairman, Adams Oshiomhole and four governors, Abiola Ajimobi, Abdullahi Ganduje, Ibikunle Amosun and Abubakar Badaru, including governor-elect Kayode Fayemi and minister of information and culture Lai Mohammed.
