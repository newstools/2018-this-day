Omololu Ogunmade in Abuja The presidency Tuesday reacted to an allegation by former Vice President Atiku Abubakar that President Muhammadu Buhari was not only uncompromising but also power drunk “who will not be ready to leave power without a fight.” In a swift reaction to the allegation, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, challenged Atiku to stop using the name of Buhari as a tool to get the presidential ticket of his party. He insisted that whereas the “President is truly uncompromising, but only when it comes to looting the common patrimony of Nigerians, and squandering their riches.” Arguing that the president is committed to the war against corruption without fear or favour, Adesina added that Buhari is equally resolute in ensuring that Nigeria is no longer a mono-product economy. However, he said the claim that the president was drunk with power was untrue, saying instead, the president handles power with a sense of decency adding that the ex-vice-president’s choice of words did not portray him as a statesman.
