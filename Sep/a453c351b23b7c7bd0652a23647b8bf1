By  Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja The All Progressives Congress (APC)  has expressed satisfaction with the conduct of the Osun governorship election held on Saturday. The party described as baseless,  the insistence by Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that INEC should declare its candidate who polled the highest votes, the winner of the contest despite its inconclusive nature. In a statement issued by the acting National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabene, the party commended the  electorate; Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC); security agencies and relevant stakeholders over the conduct of Saturday’s inconclusive governorship election in the state which it said was largely peaceful despite some reported irregularities. The party said: ” While we continue to improve on our electoral processes, particularly correcting some irregularities witnessed in Saturday’s election, the APC commends the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration which has continually exhibited its commitment to ensuring that elections are more peaceful, transparent, credible and acceptable.” APC said the exercise was a departure from the situation under past PDP’s administrations where the people’s will was subverted and elections where manipulated.
“We hereby reject the PDP’s baseless calls that the inconclusive Osun governorship election is announced in its favour. “In the leadup to the rerun election, we call on the Osun electorate, party supporters and members to remain upbeat and focused on the task of consolidating on the APC Change administration in the state by voting for the victory of our candidate, Gboyega Oyetola,” it said.
