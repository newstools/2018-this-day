Kuni Tyessi, Abuja In an effort aimed at enhancing the teaching of core science subjects such as Biology, Chemistry and Physics, a software known as Asspps- Isbors software and technology has been developed. The software which is technology- driven with a focus on secondary school science teachers, has the ability to checkmate educational challenges and create an opportunity for science teachers to earn more money. The Founder and Chief Promoter, Mr. Patrick Ochuba who revealed this during a presentation of the software, at the Federal Ministry of Education headquarters in Abuja, said technology has not only made things easier but is the most potent part of democracy in Nigeria. He said with the new software, there will be increased motivation to the teaching workforce and millions of new jobs will be created to tackle the rising issue of unemployment, as well as the quantitative and qualitative appraisal of teachers and students.. According to him, “Government cannot solve the complex educational challenges alone without valuable and creative inputs from the private sector. From the private sector perspectives and within the mandates of the ministerial strategic plan, the economic recovery growth plan and other ministries, departments and agencies, we built on innovative software solution and business model. “This, seamlessly and consistently would ingest multiple of billions of private sector funds, year-in-year-out to national education development by providing sustainable digital solutions to real challenges facing science school teachers and students in Nigeria, while meeting the commercial, branding and other needs of both local and multinational brands and business interests purposefully integrated into the platform.”
