He warned that the trials is purely for visually impaired players and is open to all that fall within that category and advised those not connected with blind football to stay clear of the trials. He appealed for a large turn out of players from where only the very best would be selected to represent Nigeria.

He added that those who excel at the end of the exercise would be selected for the national team and invited to camp towards adequate preparations for the continental football fiesta in Abidjan According to him, the federation is taking the continental championship very seriously hence the collaboration with the BINA Foundation for Persons with Special needs for an open and transparent trials in Enugu The Para-Athletic Secretary General therefore appealed to all talented but visually impaired football players to storm Enugu for the exercise and warned  that any  player  that did not turn up for the the trials would not be part of the national team no matter how good he may be.
