Femi Ogbonnikan In Abeokuta Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has condoled with the President of the United States, Mr. Donald Trump, over the death of the country’s former President, Mr. George H.W Bush Snr. The 94 year old former US leader died on Saturday.
In a letter of condolence, which was made available to newsmen by Obasanjo’s media Aide, Kehinde Akinyemi, on Sunday, the former President said he received the news of the death of the erstwhile US leader with rude shock.
According to Obasanjo, “President Bush’s death is a loss, not only to his immediate family and to the United States of America, but also to the entire world.” The former Nigerian President described Bush’s tenure as one that “marked a significant departure from the traditional relations between Africa and the United States. “With the refocused and renewed emphasis on market reforms, political and social accountability, and stronger trade relations, his legacies have continued over the years to shape Africa’s relations with the United States.”
Obasanjo further noted that, “President Bush’s special interest in Nigeria was reflective of the special relations between our two countries. “We join you and the American people in mourning the loss of a political giant, an astute administrator, a courageous leader, an erudite international statesman, and a great American hero. “Though the world would miss him, his legacies would continue to inspire many to reach the highest points of their productive, political and creative abilities. “Once again, accept our deep sympathies. May God grant his soul perfect peace and rest.”
