• Balance of payments down to $4.5bn deficit in 2018 Q3 • Higher food prices push inflation to 11.28% Obinna Chima in Lagos, Shola Oyeyipo, Adedayo Akinwale and James Emejo in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday in Abuja told the 36 state governors that the Nigerian economy was in bad shape and that Nigerians would need to tighten their belts. Chairman of Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) cum Governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, disclosed this to State House correspondents after the governors met with President Buhari in the Council Chambers of the presidential villa. The President’s alarm on the economy came on the day it emerged that the provisional estimates for Nigeria’s Balance of Payments (BOP) in the third quarter of 2018, showed the overall BOP swinging into a deficit of US$4.542 billion, compared to surpluses of $503.97 million and $2.787 billion recorded in the preceding quarter and corresponding period of 2017, respectively. Also, report released yesterday by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures inflation, increased to 11.28 per cent (year-on-year) in November compared to 11.26 percent in the preceding month. Governor Yari said: “President Buhari told us that the economy is in bad shape and that we have to come together, think and rethink on the way forward.” The meeting of the governors with the President was to find a lasting solution to the unresolved issue of new minimum wage for Nigerian workers after they had met Thursday night to take a position on the matter. Although Yari did not disclose government’s decision on the new minimum wage, he noted that the President, “talked to us in a manner that we have task ahead of us. We should tighten our belts and see how we can put the Nigerian economy in the right direction”. According to him, Buhari blamed the previous administrations led by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for Nigeria’s infrastructure decay despite huge petrol revenue. “He (Buhari) wondered what happened in the past; that for the 16 years of the now opposition party, the PDP in power and with oil at 2.1 million barrels per day at an average of $100, many infrastructure are in bad shape,” Yari said. The governor said contrary to the president’s initial resolution not to make reference to the decadence that characterised the PDP leadership, “Buhari is compelled to bring those issues before Nigerians so that they can decide if it is best to bring the former ruling party back to power”. “He is going to open a vigorous campaign and these are key issues that he is going to raise with Nigerians so that they can weigh their choices,” Yari added. Speaking on behalf of other governors at a special extended National Economic Council Meeting and the launch of Human Capital Development Programme with the theme: ‘Healthy, Educated and Productive Nigerians for a Globally Competitive Nation by 2030,’ held at the old banquet hall, presidential villa, Abuja, Yari made a case for more funding for all levels of governments. He told the gathering that there was need for political decisions that would expand the Nigerian economy to generate funding for every arm of government to develop human capital and address other sundry issues. In his remark at the event, Osinbajo urged the governors and other stakeholders to desist from blame game and resist playing politics with issues of human capital development. Noting that the issue of human capital development was perhaps the most important in Nigeria today, Osinbajo asked: “What can be more important than the well-being of the people you serve? We are aware of this and this is so with the state governments and we are committed to ensuring that we positively transform from the Nigerian experience as it relates to the quality of life and well-being of our people.” Nigeria’s Balance of Payments Down to $4.5bn Deficit in Q3 Meanwhile, the provisional estimates for Nigeria’s Balance of Payments (BOP) in the third quarter (Q3) 2018, showed the overall BOP swinging into a deficit of US$4.542 billion, compared to surpluses of $503.97 million and $2.787 billion recorded in the preceding quarter and corresponding period of 2017, respectively.

Higher Food Prices Push Inflation to 11.28% In a related development, the consumer price index (CPI), which measures inflation increased to 11.28 percent (year-on-year) in November compared to 11.26 percent in the preceding month, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).The 0.02 per cent points increase resulted from price increases in all the divisions that constitute the Headline index.

Core inflation, which excludes the prices of volatile agricultural products, was down by 0.1 per cent from the 9.9 per cent recorded in October. PDP to Buhari: Your Admission of Failure Means It’s Time to Go Also yesterday, the PDP said Buhari had validated his rejection by Nigerians by admitting, before state governors, that he had failed to fix the economy of the nation, in negation of his 2015 campaign promises. The party in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, asked Nigerians to tighten their belts, as Buhari has admitted that the country’s economy has terribly worsened under his incompetent watch and that he has no solution to our economic realities. According to him, “Nigerians must hold President Buhari directly responsible for the official flops, harsh economic policies and humongous corruption in his regime, which led to the collapse of our once robust economy, turned our nation to the poverty capital of the world with the worse form of hunger and starvation to the extent compatriots now consider suicide mission and slavery as options.”
