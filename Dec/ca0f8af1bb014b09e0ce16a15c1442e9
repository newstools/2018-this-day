The Governor urged parents and stakeholders to encourage their children and wards to engage in sporting activities “we must also, begin to encourage our children to engage in sporting activities because of the economic factor involved; if we are able to get the young ones not just to win laurels for our nation Nigeria but, help themselves and others who are close to them; it is important to put a lot of money into sports development because of the benefits and am glad we encouraged the athletes to win more laurels with various cash gifts we promised them. “Our administration is inspired to invest in sports development by the achievements recorded by previous administrations in the state as well as that of General Samuel Ogbemudia when he was the Governor of the defunct Bendel State,” he added
