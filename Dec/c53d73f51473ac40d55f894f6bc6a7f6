First City Monument Bank (FCMB) said on Wednesday that it had received $3 million as part of the proceeds from the sale of debt-laden telecoms firm 9mobile, which was seized by its lenders and sold to new investors. In November, Teleology completed a takeover of 9mobile, the countryâ€™s fourth biggest operator, ending a long bidding process for the debt-laden company that started a year ago. FCMB has around $4 billion exposure to 9mobile, the bank said
