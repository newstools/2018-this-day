Goddy Egene C &I Leasing Plc has applied to reduce its issued and paid-up share capital from N808.505 million, which is 1,617,010,000 ordinary shares of 50 kobo each to N202,126, 250 share being 404,252,500 ordinary shares of 50 kobo each. In notification to the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), C & I Leasing Plc yesterday said the reduction would be achieved through the consolidation of every four ordinary shares currently held into one new share in the company. The share capital so reduced, it said, would be added to the company’s share premium account. “The purpose of the reconstruction is to allow the company to have enough unissued shares to accommodate future plans to raise capital through the equity capital market. The additional capital will be used to finance the company’s expansion plan, extinguish some liabilities and enhance the company’s capital mix,” the company said. According to the company, the qualification date for the share consolidation shall be Wednesday 12th December 2018 while the shares of the company will be placed on suspension from Thursday 13th December 2018 to Thursday 27th December 2018 to allow for the consolidation exercise.
