Members of our ethnic groups have been engaged and appointed by his government. What more can we ask for?” he asked. He also noted that tremendous progress have been made in all sectors by the administration in spite of daunting economic challenges from falling oil price and immense inherited debt. The leaders of Igbo, Edo and Hausa, Chief Anthony Ndajiuba, Tony Azeta and Alhaji Bako Balarabe, unanimously showered praises on Okowa for creating a peaceful environment for their businesses to thrive. Leader of Team Okowa/Otuaro 2019, Chief Favour Izuokumor commended the various ethnic groups for their continuous support for the present administration in the state. “This unity of purpose is unique and significant; it is a pointer that we, Nigerians, hold the key to Nigeria’s development and its future. You have shown the spirit of peace, unity and tolerance. It is against this background that I want to commend the leaders of the various ethnic groups, who have taken the bull by the horn. It is good to see that you have shunned political and other sentiments to queue behind a man who represents a genuine cause. This is how politics should be, ” he said.
