Chineme Okafor in Abuja Nigerians consumed a total of 479 million litres of petrol from January 2018 to September 2018, representing an average of 53.2 million litres daily for nine months, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), has disclosed. NNPC’s operational and financial results for September 2018 also showed that the country consumed 80 million litres of petrol per day in March 2018, up from the 41 million litres consumed daily in December 2017. The corporation also indicated that its refineries in Warri, Port Harcourt, and Kaduna, which have a combined refining capacity of 445,000 barrels per day, made profit only in one month in a period of one year – September 2017 to September 2018. In the operations and financial report for the month of September 2018, which was obtained by THISDAY yesterday in Abuja, the corporation stated that while daily petrol consumption by Nigeria’s domestic market jumped from 41 million litres in December 2017 to 80 million litres in March 2018, the refineries were only able to make a profit of N6.3 billion in April of 2018, and recorded losses in the other 11 months. According to the NNPC, in September 2017, daily national petroleum consumption was 31 million litres.
The daily consumption, however, moved up to 52 million litres in October; 26 million litres in November; 41 million in December and 49 million in January 2018. According to the report, the rise in consumption levels continued in February with 67 million litres, and then hit the all time high of 80 million in March.

The corporation had explained in the recent past that most of the petrol it imported into Nigeria was smuggled out to the neighboring West African countries where the price of product was higher than Nigeria’s N145 official price
It had also stated that it was working with the Nigerian Customs to stop such smuggling operations. Refineries Recorded Profit Once in One Year With regards to the operations of its refineries, NNPC, explained that in September 2017, they recorded a deficit of N3.5 billion; N7.7 billion in October; N11.14 billion in November and N11.095 billion in December.
