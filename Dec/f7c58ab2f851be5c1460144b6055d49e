President Donald Trump had had allowed a shutdown of the government of the United States over his inability to get support of the legislature in the building of the Mexican wall.
While campaigning for the US presidency in 2016, Trump had promised to erect a wall between the United States and Mexico to check the rising illegal migration from that country, assuring that the Mexican government would bear the cost of erecting the wall. However when the Mexican government declined to fund the wall, Trump then turned to the US Congress, seeking the sum of $5bn to fund the project. But Congress also refused to grant the request, prompting the President to announce his willingness to shut down the government.
