The Nigerian Army has called for the closure of the Amnesty International offices in Nigeria, alleging there is credible evidence the organisation is working hard to destabilise the country. The army spokesman, Brig.-Gen. Sani Usman said in a statement on Monday that the organisation’s attempt to destabilise the nation was noted through fabrication of fictitious allegations of alleged human rights abuses against the Nigerian security forces. Usman also alleged the AI had engaged in clandestine sponsorship of dissident groups to protest, as well as unfounded allegations against the leadership of the Nigerian military. A coalition of Civil Society Organisations (Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, Enough is Enough, and BudgIT) have recently called for the probe of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) over the funding of the war against terrorism and other crimes in the country. The CSOs alleged the army had not made commensurate achievement in the fight in line with the huge fund the federal government allocated to the fight. The COAS, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, had however explained that some of the allocated funds had yet to be cash backed and that it had not reached the army. Usman said the Nigerian branch of AI that had hitherto been well respected had deviated from the core values, principles and objectives of the original parent body in the United Kingdom. “They have tried over the years using Boko Haram terrorists conflicts, Islamic Movement in Nigeria, some activists and now herders-farmers conflicts. “The NGO is at the verge of releasing yet another concocted report against the military, ostensibly against the Nigerian Army. “Consequently, Nigerians should be wary of Amnesty International (Nigeria) because its goals are to destabilise Nigeia and to dismember it. “The Nigerian Army has no option than to call for the closure of Amnesty International offices in Nigeria, if such recklessness continues.
