By Goddy Egene It was a positive performance for the Nigerian equities market last week after four weeks of decline as increased buying interest in bellwethers lifted the market. The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index rose 0.33 per cent to close at 30,773.64, while market capitalisation rose by same margin to be at N11.241 trillion. Similarly, all other indices finished higher with the exception of the NSE CG and NSE Banking Indices that depreciated by 0.05 per cent and 2.20 per cent respectively while the NSE ASeM index closed flat. The renewed interest in FBN Holdings Plc, Nestle Nigeria Plc and Dangote Cement Plc outweighed sell offs in Access Bank Plc, Union Bank of Nigeria Plc and Ecobank Transnational Incorporated. With last week, the year-to-date decline of the ASI moderated to 19.5 per cent. An analysis of the market performance showed that four out of five sectors tracked closed in green.  The NSE Insurance Index recorded the highest gain of 3.5 per cent as a result of appreciation in the shares of NE Insurance Plc and WAPIC Insurance Plc. The NSE Oil & Gas Index and NSE Industrial Goods Index went up by 2.3 per cent and 1.1 per cent respectively following buying interest in Forte Oil Plc, Double One Plc, Cement Company of Northern Nigeria Plc and Dangote Cement Plc. Similarly, price appreciation in Nestle and Nigerian Breweries lifted the NSE Consumer Goods Index by 0.9 per cent higher.  However, on the flip side the NSE Banking Index fell by 2.2 per cent due to decline in the shares of Access Bank Plc and ETI. Although Access Bank Plc remained in the news last week due to its move to acquire Diamond Bank Plc, its share price suffered a decline, while that of Diamond Bank Plc appreciated. Specifically, Access Bank Plc shed 5.2 per cent, while Diamond Bank Plc jumped by 57.89 per cent. However, the swoop on the shares of Diamond Bank, which led to the jump in price, was expected given the terms of the merger with Access Bank. The proposed merger would involve Access Bank acquiring the entire issued share capital of Diamond Bank in exchange for a combination of cash and shares in Access Bank via a Scheme of Merger. Based on the agreement reached by the boards of the two financial institutions, Diamond Bank shareholders would receive a consideration of N3.13 per share, comprising of N1 per share in cash and the allotment of two new Access Bank ordinary shares for every seven Diamond Bank ordinary shares held as at the implementation date. Immediately following completion of the merger, Diamond Bank would be absorbed into Access Bank and it will cease to exist under Nigerian law. And some stock market operators said the business combination was a welcome development that seemed to be more favourable to Diamond Bank Plc. Mr. David Adonri of Highcap Securities Limited, said: Diamond Bank Plc has been failing. Merger with Access Bank has finally rescued the bank from imminent collapse. The terms of merger weigh heavily in favour of Diamond Bank Plc.” Market Turnover Meanwhile, the value and volume of trading also went up last week with investors trading 1.472 billion shares worth N18.678 billion in 15,610 deals compared with 1.169 billion shares valued at N14.762 billion that exchanged hands the previous week in 14,554 deals.
