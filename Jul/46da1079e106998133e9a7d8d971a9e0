Twenty-eight years after its last appearance in the semi- final of the world cup, the Three Lions of England booked their place in the last four of Russia 2018 with a 2 – 0 win over Sweden. Harry Maguire and Dele Alli were the goal heroes as England saw off Sweden to make the World Cup semi-finals. The Leicester defender powered in a header from a corner after half an hour to make fans across the country back home delirious. Alli buried another header in the 59th minute to make it 2-0 as England continued to dominate. Gareth Southgate’s men were also indebted to Everton keeper Jordan Pickford who pulled off a string of superb saves to preserve the Three Lions’ lead.
