Deji Elumoye in Abuja Senate President Bukola Saraki Tuesday formally resigned from the All Progressive Congress, APC, saying he was forced out of the party by fifth columnists. Saraki in a 20-paragraph statement he personally signed in Ilorin, the Kwara state capital, to announce his defection from APC to PDP accused some APC leaders of frustrating him out of the party. According to him, some national leaders of APC who were opposed to resolving the crisis within the party through dialogue served as fifth columnists which led to his leaving the party eventually. His words, “there are some people in the party leadership hierarchy, who did not think dialogue was the way forward and therefore chose to play the fifth columnists. These individuals went to work and ensured that they scuttled the great efforts and the good intentions of other leaders of the party. Perhaps, had these divisive forces not thrown the cogs in the wheel at the last minutes, and in a manner that made it impossible to sustain any trust in the process, the story today would have been different.” Saraki said it took him a long time to quit the party adding that “if anything at all, I have tarried for so long and did all that was humanly possible, even in the face of great provocation, ridicule and flagrant persecution, to give opportunity for peace, reconciliation and harmonious existence.
