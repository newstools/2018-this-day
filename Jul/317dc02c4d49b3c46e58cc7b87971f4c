From shooting stars to illuminated wood, the Wraith Luminary Collection encapsulates the extraordinary talent of the Rolls-Royce Bespoke Collective. Just 55 motor cars exist, inspired by, and created for those who lead where others follow. Rolls-Royce releases a short film exploring the finer details of the Collection. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Bespoke Designer, Matthew Danton, commented, “Wraith Luminary epitomises contemporary craftsmanship. It is innovation. It is design and technology combined. Every aspect of the motor car has been taken to the next level and enhanced in some way; each feature has been magnified. Wraith Luminary is the Ultimate hand-crafted gran tourismo.”
