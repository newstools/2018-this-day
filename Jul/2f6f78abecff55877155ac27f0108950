Chairman of Chairmen of Nigerian Football, Alhaji Ibrahim Musa Gusau, has commended the Federal Government and other highly-placed individuals who helped in the peaceful resolution of the NFF leadership crisis. “We are happy with the restoration of sanity and peace in our football. That move has saved our football and saved our country’s image from being smeared unnecessarily in the international sphere. “There are 211 countries of the world who members of world football –governing body, FIFA and all of those countries adhere strictly to the tenets and dictates of association football as enshrined in the FIFA Statutes, which is duplicated in their own countries’ respective versions,” Gusau said. The Member of NFF Executive Committee and Chairman of Zamfara State Football Association also praised the members of the NFF Congress, who overwhelmingly endorsed the Amaju Pinnick-led board at emergency meetings over the weekend. Gusau reiterated that the nationwide action has shown that the Nigerian football family is united and committed to the global best practice of playing football according to Football Statutes and nothing else. He said aggrieved personalities and entities can always ventilate their grouse through established alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.
