Three people were reportedly killed while seven others, including two nursing mothers, were abducted when bandits stormed Unguwar Dan-Baki, Sabon-Layi village in Birnin-Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State last Sunday. One of the nursing mothers was said to have been abducted alongside her eight-day-old baby.
Chairman of the Birnin-Gwari Vanguards for Security and Good Governance, Ibrahim Abubakar Nagwari, in a statement yesterday said the incident occurred at about7:00p.m. The statement said the gunmen had a field day as they carted away cattle used for traction by the villagers in their farms.
The statement quoted an eye witness, Garba Tanko, as saying that the attack took place during the ‘Maghreb’ (evening) prayers. According to the statement, “The attackers had a field day carting away cattle use for animal traction by the villagers in their farms.
“The attackers are using corridors of Kamuku forest and Kuyambana forest in Zamfara State to terrorise farming communities in Birnin-Gwari ocal government territories.” The statement called on the federal government for the deployment of more security personnel to stop the influx of bandits who are being chased from Zamfara State by the military to the Birnin Gwari area. “As the military and police personnel are advancing to secure many parts of our territories from bandits and kidnappers especially along Birnin-Gwari-Kaduna road as well as Birnin-Gwari-Funtua road, we are calling on the federal government to deploy more security forces to Birnin-Gwari to prevent influx of these bandits escaping military onslaught in Zamfara State to Birnin-Gwari,” the group said. The spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command, Mukhtar Aliyu, could not be reached to react on the incident as his mobile phone was not connecting.
