ITB Nigeria Limited is set to complete its first steel and concrete building project known as the Azuri Peninsula, in Eko Atlantic City, Lagos State. In a statement made available to THISDAY by the Managing Director of ITB Nigeria, Mr. Ramzi Chidiac, the firm described the Azuri Peninsula project, which began in 2015 as a unique steel and concrete residential building project that consists of three set of over 30 storey towers. The statement also noted that the project offers a unique collection of four-bedroom luxury and super luxury apartments, two and four-bedroom stunning Marina Town houses as well as s six-bedroom simplex (penthouses).
Chidiac in the statement expressed satisfaction with the project, stating that it would be the first composite structure created by a combination of steel and concrete to form a single element. “This helps to deliver performance that is more effective than when individual components are used together but not unified. This testifies to the excellent work that we do at ITB Nigeria,” he stated. Chidiac explained that the firm is focused on fully understanding the needs of its clients and delivering on their promises, “regardless of the scale or complexity of the challenge at hand.” “Steel and concrete structures involve a mix of steel and concrete together to form a single element. The tensile capacity of the steel and the compressive capacity of the concrete result in a standard structure.
“This gives rise to benefits like speed, performance and value. Additionally, concrete encasement protects the steel from buckling, corrosion and fire,” the statement added.
