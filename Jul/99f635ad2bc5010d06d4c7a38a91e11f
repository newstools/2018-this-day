The Nigerian equities market opened the week on a positive note as the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All Share Index rose by 0.30 per cent to 36,711.96. This was just as bargain hunting entered its second day. After a losing streak that saw the NSE ASI fall to new record low, the market pared the losses last Friday. The positive trend was maintained yesterday leading an appreciation of 0.30 per cent. Similarly, market capitalisation rose by same margin to close higher at N13.30 trillion. The appreciation recorded in the share prices of some highly capitalised companies such as UBA, Dangote Cement, Nigerian Breweries, FBN Holdings, and Zenith Bank Plc bolster the performance. However, Cutix Plc led the price gainers with 10 per cent, trailed by Continental Reinsurance Plc with 6.0 per cent.

AIICO Insurance Plc, Champion Breweries Plc, Oando Plc and Jaiz Bank Plc went down by 8.9 per cent, 7.3 per cent, 7.2 per cent and 6.1 per cent respectively.
