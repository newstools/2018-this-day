Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti The Ekiti State Police Command has justified the deployment of armed policemen to the premises of Ekiti State House of Assembly, saying it did so to guarantee the safety of the lawmakers and staff of the House. When contacted on the telephone to speak on the alarm raised by the Speaker, Hon. Kola Oluwawole, that there was a grand plot to cause confusion by some lawmakers in cahoot with the police, the Public Relations Officer of the command, Mr. Caleb Ikechukwu, said there was nothing wrong with the deployment. Ikechukwu said: “Anytime you see the deployment of policemen, it is to ensure the safety and the security of that place and the people there.” The police spokesman added that there was no need for people to be curious about the deployment of security men in the quest to ensure the security of life and property, except for those who have some form of crime to hide. He said: “Anytime you see us doing deployment, it’s for a reason; it’s to ensure safety of that place at a given time. That means there must be information which we are working with. And what that shows is how proactive the Nigeria Police Force is.” On the alleged letter seeking for deployment of policemen to the House, Ikechukwu said: “Are you now meddling into our internal affairs? Anybody that disclosed that information is disclosing a secret information and that person should be arrested and prosecuted.”
