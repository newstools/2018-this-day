Seriki Adinoyi in Jos Christian leaders in Northern Nigeria have called on the federal and Plateau State governments to ensure that the internally displaced persons (IDPs) are returned to their homes from the camps by re-building their houses that were destroyed during last month’s attacks by suspected Fulani herdsmen. The Chairman of the Northern Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev Yakubu Pam, stated this when he led the other officials of the association on a visit to Gashshi district of Barkinladi Local Government Council where the attackers wreak havoc on the community. The cleric said that the attackers and killers of the villagers in their homeland would not go unpunished as the long arm of the law would soon catch up with them. He said that the IDPs should be returned immediately to their homes and communities to avoid a situation where the attackers would take over their lands and homes as witnessed in previous attacks. He demanded adequate security for the villagers on returning to their villages, adding that relief materials should be taken to them in their homes. Responding, the victims told the Christian leaders that during the attacks, military personnel in the area looked away. Pastor Gyang Bulus, a church leader in the community, said: “The soldiers told us that they were not directed by their superiors to intervene and as such there was nothing they could do.” Pam called on the state government to do more to make life worth living again for the people. The Christian leaders donated bags of rice and other grains, and undisclosed amount of money to the IDPs, encouraging them to be strong against all odds.
