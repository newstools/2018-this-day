Son of former Military Governor of Lagos State, General Buba Marwa, Imran, has bagged a first class degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering from Loughborough University, United Kingdom. Imran, born in April 1998 when General Marwa was military governor of Lagos State, topped the list of First Class graduands in Electronics and Electrical Engineering at Loughborough University 2018 graduation ceremony held Thursday. In his graduation photograph, Imran wore his academic gown flanked by his parents, General Buba and Munirat Marwa. In the photograph, Imran was not wearing mortar board in line with Loughborough’s tradition. In Loughborough, bachelors degrees do not wear mortar boards, only masters degrees do. “I am very happy and grateful to God. May our country reap the benefits of our collective efforts and achievements. God bless Nigeria,” Imran said in response to a question on how he feels about his graduation. Loughborough was ranked fourth on The Guardian University League Table 2017.
