By Seriki Adinoyi in Jos The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Region 8, Plateau State has donated three trucks and two buses of assorted food items and other sundry items to the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Barakin-Ladi Local Government area of the state. Presenting the items, the Special Assistant to the General Overseer of the RCCG, who is also the Pastor in charge of Region 8, Pastor Sunday Edward Akande, condemned the killings and commiserated with the people and government of the state over the sad event, calling on both the government and security agencies to carry out a thorough investigation into the attack with a view to avoiding a repeat of it. He tasked government authorities to sit up and address the security challenges head on, noting that any government that is not able to protect its citizens is irrelevant. Akande, who visited three IDP camps in Barakin Ladi along with other clerics of the church, observed that food was the most important item that the IDPs needed urgently at the moment to cushion and ameliorate their predicament. “That is why we are moved to make these donations at this point in time. This gesture is to cushion the hardship being experienced at the moment as Internal Displaced Persons,” he said. Encouraging the IDPs, he said: “We all know that it is not your own making that you are here; none of you is happy to be here. But because situation calls for it, we decided to come and identify with you. There is nothing we will give you that will be equal to what you have lost, but the little we have come with is just to support you.” He urged government to intensify effort to ensure that the displaced persons return to their homes in the shortest possible time. Items donated include 31 bags of rice, 10 bags of maize, 18 bags of beans, 25 cartons of indomie of assorted  seasoning, five bags of salt and 25 bags of Semovita, and clothing among others
