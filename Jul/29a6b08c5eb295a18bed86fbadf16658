Across all our business lines, we witnessed strong underlying performance, translating into improved earnings. We continue to focus on the recovery of non-performing loans. With the resolution in Q2 2018 of the large real estate exposure which was impaired in December 2017, the Group NPL ratio is down to 10.8 per cent from 14.9 per cent at 31 March 2018 and 19.8 per cent at 31 December 2017.” Also speaking, Chief Financial Officer of the bank, Oyinkan Adewale said: “We are pleased that for the first time since 2012, the group’s retained earnings moved from a negative to a positive position, thus eliminating a major technical impediment to the payment of dividends. Operating Expenses for the period were affected by some one-off items, as well as a combined 25 per cent increase in NDIC premium and AMCON levy. For the rest of the year, we will intensify our cost rationalisation initiatives.”
