 The Edo State Commissioner for Education, Hon. Emmanuel Agbale, has revealed plans by the state government to fit selected public schools in the state with sick bays manned by medical staff. Agbale disclosed this during the presentation of First Aid kits by the South-South Zone of the National Lottery Trust Fund (NLTF) to nine public schools in the state. He expressed appreciation to NLTF for picking Edo State as a beneficiary of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) project. He noted that the equipment would be put to effective use, as the state plans to establish sick bays in public schools to be supported by doctors and nurses from the state’s health institutions. The Commissioner appealed for the state government’s input in the selection of schools to benefit from its CSR gestures, as it was in a better position to identify disadvantaged schools, noting that this would increase the impact of its efforts. Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Mrs. Ruth Obahiagbon, lauded the NLTF over the quality of the equipment, adding that NLTF should not relent in its efforts to support government in providing essential needs. The Legal Head, NLTF, South/South Zone, Mr. Ekene Ekweozor explained that the essence of the NLTF intervention is to ensure students and pupils have access to quality health care in schools and reduce the high rate of injuries in schools. He said the equipment will provide the school with tools to better manage emergencies. The first aid cabinets handed over to representatives of the selected benefitting schools contain stethoscopes, curved scissors, drugs, latex gloves, amongst others.
