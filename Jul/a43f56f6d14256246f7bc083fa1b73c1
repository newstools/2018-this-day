For some time now, there have been accusations and counter-accusations between Tope Adebutu and her estranged husband, Jowon Obasanjo, making many to think that their one-year-old marriage was heading for the rock. Contrary to the thinking in some quarters, the enstranged loverbirds are about to come together once again. A reliable source disclosed that the two warring families led by former President Olusegun Obasanjo and billionaire businessman, Kensington Adebutu, met a few days ago shortly after Obasanjo returned from China to find a lasting solution to the ‘war’ between the couple that has generated massive media reportage. The source hinted that Junwo was not at the meeting, which was described as successful. Until this development, Jowon had reportedly dragged Temitope before the Ogun State Judicial Service Commission and the Magistrate Court in Lagos Island over allegations of domestic violence against him. He accused Temitope subjected him to repeated acts of domestic violence death threats. However, the Adebutu family, especially Temitope’s mother, rose in defence of her daughter, accusing her son-in-law of being economical with the truth. It will be recalled that Juwon’s mother, Taiwo Obasanjo, made a fuss about the wedding last year when she went to court to try to stop it. She had claimed that she received a spiritual warning against her son having a big wedding and that if he wanted to throw an elaborate wedding at all, it must be done after his 34th birthday in June. Despite her pleas and objection, Juwon’s and Tope, with the full support of their fathers, had a flamboyant wedding in May last year.
