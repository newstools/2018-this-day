A lucky driver-partner signed on to Uber, today drove home a brand new car courtesy of Uber’s uberFREEKICK campaign. The presentation of the car was done at the Uber Greenlight Hub – a dedicated support centre for driver-partners in Lagos. Speaking at the presentation, Lola Kassim; General Manager West Africa, Uber said: “Our unique brand proposition at Uber is that we are committed to creating business and economic opportunities, especially for driver-partners. We value our driver community and are always looking at ways in which we can make their experience more memorable on Uber. We’re excited to continue stimulating growth across a broad range of sectors within the Nigerian socio-economic space.” The lucky driver-partner, Banjo Olayemi couldn’t hide his joy and surprise at being announced the winner of the brand new car. “I am very happy to be the winner of the brand new car; I almost didn’t believe it, but my name was called repeatedly. My appreciation goes to the management of Uber for this great initiative and for truly supporting drivers in word and in deed. Owning a new car means I can be more efficient with my work, and offer my riders excellent service.” According to Osi Oguah; Senior Driver Operations Manager for Nigeria, Uber “This competition was open to all driver-partners with active accounts in Lagos or Abuja.” Shedding more light on the metrics for selecting a winner, he said: “The winner of the uberFREEKICK competition needed to complete 40 trips per week in Lagos or Abuja during the competition period, in addition to meeting other criteria.” In the coming week, the uberFREEKICK train moves to the capital city of Abuja, where another lucky driver-partner will go home with a brand new car. Uber recently commemorated its Fourth year of operations in the city of Lagos. The global technology brand also unveiled its new advert campaign tagged “Moments that Matter.”
