Deji Elumoye in Abuja Senate President Bukola Saraki Monday night said the invitation by the Police that he should report to a station in Guzape, Abuja over the April 5 Offa bank robbery investigation was a mere afterthought designed to achieve political purpose. Saraki in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, stated that he had it on good authority that the Police had already decided on the suspects to arraign in court in Ilorin, Kwara State on Wednesday based on the advice of the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), Mohammed U.E, and that the turn around to invite him was a ploy aimed at scoring cheap political points. Linking his police invite to the planned defection of some APC members in the National Assembly, Saraki declared that
“I have been reliably informed that the police invitation was planned by IG as a ploy to stop an alleged plan by some Senators and House of Representatives members from defecting from the All Progressives Congress (APC). It was also said that if I was detained between Tuesday and Wednesday, that will abort the so-called defection plan. “While I continue to maintain that the issue of my position on the 2019 elections is not a personal decision for me alone to make, it should be noted that all these concoctions and evil plot cannot deter me. Those behind this fresh assault will fail as I have nothing to do with the robbery incident or any criminal matter for that matter. “I am aware that following a request made by the Police on June 13, 2018 to the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) of the Federation, he had written a legal advice dated June 22, 2018, in which he stated on page 5, paragraph (f) that “For the Senate President and the Kwara State Governor, this office is unable to establish from the evidence in the interim report a nexus between the alleged office and the suspects”.
