AFRICAN YOUTH GAMES Nigeria’s Under-15 Future Eagles opened their African title defence on winning note yesterday as they came from two goals down to defeat Morocco 3-2 in their African Youth Games opening match in Algier. A brace from Divine Nwachukwu and Chidera Ejiofor’s strike ensured Danladi Nasidi’s lads subdued their North African opponents in the Group A encounter. After the game against Morocco yesterday, the Nigerian U-15 will take on Djibouti on Saturday and Libya on Monday. Nigeria did not participate in the football event of the first African Youth Games in Rabat but won four out of five matches, drawing the other to emerge winners of the football gold at the second edition in Gaborone, Botswana four years ago. In judo, Nigeria picked silver medal in the -100kg category of the Youth Games as Madu Daniel defeated an Algerian judoka to pick the precious silverware. Team Nigeria also got to the podium in weightlifting as Ajayi James won three silver medals in the 56kg category.
