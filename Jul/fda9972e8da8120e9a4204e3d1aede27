Ernest Chinwo in Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has stated that his administration was able to pay the salaries of civil servants for June 2018 without releases from Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) because of careful financial engineering. Addressing journalists after projects inspection yesterday, Wike said workers welfare is a top priority of his administration. He said: “Our business is to pay workers salaries, do projects and develop the state. We reasoned, do we because FAAC has not been released, fail to pay workers salaries? “We had to do some financial engineering to accomodate workers salaries, while projects are still going on. We came to serve and there are no excuses.” The governor noted that his administration is built around making Rivers people happy through projects and programmes that would enhance their well-being. He inspected the on-going construction of the Bonny-Bille-Nembe Jetty that would serve Rivers riverine communities and their Bayelsa neighbours. He expressed satisfaction with the quality of work and the percentage completion at the jetty.
He solicited the understanding of traders around the premises as they will be relocated to create space for the contractors to conclude the shore protection of the jetty.
