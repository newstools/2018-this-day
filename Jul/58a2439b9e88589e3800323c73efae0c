By Senator Iroegbu in Abuja The Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, has said that the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has commenced the process of reactivating its crime laboratory, which has been inactive for over 30 years, to keep up with the dynamics of crime and contemporary security threats which have challenged the capacity of the Air Provost to carry out its mandate. Abubakar disclosed this Monday while speaking at the 2018 Air Provost Conference with the theme: “Scientific Approach to Crime Prevention: A Prerequisite for Contemporary Air Police Operations.” He emphasised the need to adapt a more modern approach to policing and crime fighting, an approach that leverages on technology and scientific methods. “It is envisaged that with more emphasis on the use of scientific aids to policing, the Air Provost would be better poised to speedily and effectively discharge its law enforcement and security duties with a higher degree of accuracy. “Already, the Provost Investigation Centre has been upgraded into a group status, and as I speak, the expansion, remodelling and reactivation of the Provost Investigation Group’s Crime Laboratory which has been disused for over 30 years is ongoing. I am optimistic that once the crime laboratory becomes operational, forensic investigation will receive a boost in the NAF. “To this end, the Provost would need to acquire both indigenous and foreign expertise and experiences that would keep it abreast with the latest trends and developments in crime fighting and security. The acquisition of these capacities would be crucial to the Provost’s relevance and resilience in a dynamic environment,” he said. He regretted that previous approach to crime fighting has become ineffective owing to the advancement of technology which has escalated crime rates and modalities.
