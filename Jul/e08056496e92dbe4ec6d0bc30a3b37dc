Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has hailed the defection of Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, from the All Progressives Congress and welcomed him back to its fold. The party also urged all its members in APC to return back ‘home’ and salvage the nation. In a statement issued by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP said the return of the governor to PDP confirmed the fact that President Muhammadu Buhari led-administration and the All Progressives Congress (APC) did not have the welfare of Nigerians at heart, as they have continually offered flimsy excuses over the mindless killings that have caused untold sorrows across the country, particularly in Benue State. The party said that the Buhari-led federal government had failed in its basic responsibility of protecting lives, property and territorial integrity of the nation. “Painfully, Nigerians are being slaughtered in Benue, Taraba, Plateau, kaduna, Zamfara, Sokoto, nearly on daily basis.” PDP praised Governor Ortom for showing patriotic courage and boldness in these times of brazen dictatorship.
PDP commended the governor for standing firm by the people of Benue State and refusing to mortgage their welfare to a government that has consistently demonstrated cluelessness. “We urge the governor to be rest assured that he will be accorded his dues and rights as a member of the PDP.
“The return of Governor Ortom to our party, which is a reflection of his people’s desires, further confirms the rejection of the Buhari -led APC administration by Nigerians. “It also buttresses the fact that PDP remains the viable platform for all Nigerians that are desirous of rescuing our nation from the gross misgovernance and authoritarianism exhibited by the APC-led administration”.
