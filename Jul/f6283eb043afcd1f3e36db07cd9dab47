By Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is down and desperately seeking for help from a coalition to recover.
In a statement issued by the National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Bolaji Abdulahi, APC accused the PDP of trying to hide its irredeemably bad image under the heap of a new coalition. “After three years in the wilderness, the PDP is understandably excited with possibility of hiding its irredeemably bad image under the heap of a new coalition.
“Like the vulture, PDP sees every altercation as a potential opportunity for a feast.
“If PDP is not alleging wild conspiracies, they are threatening to boycott elections or announcing fake defections. What is clear with all these is that no matter how long a leopard lives, it cannot change its spots,” it said.
APC however, lampooned PDP for failing to put its house in order, a situation that led to the mass exodus which crippled the party. The ruling party said on its part,  it was only acting responsibly by seeking to reconcile with aggrieved members.
“What President Muhammadu Buhari and Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, the National Chairman of our party are doing, persuading every aggrieved member not to leave the Party, is what responsible and sensible party leaders would do. Party politics is a game of number. 
“And that game is addition. If the PDP had the same presence of mind in 2015, perhaps the calamity that befell them would have been averted.
“We challenge the PDP to face Nigerians on their own merit in 2019 and stop shopping around for supporters,” it said.
