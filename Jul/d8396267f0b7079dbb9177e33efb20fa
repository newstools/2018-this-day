Less than 24 hours to the commencement of the 21st Africa Senior Athletics Championships (CAA) Asaba 2018, Delta State Governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa has performed the symbolic hoisting of flags of participating nations at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba. Performing the brief but, colourful ceremony yesterday the Governor heaved sigh of relief that after months of strident efforts to make the stadium ready for the event, everything that will make the championship hitch-free has been put in place. “This championship means a lot to the people of Asaba, Delta State, Nigeria, but, particularly, to us as government, Asaba is agog as we look forward to host a successful championship. “In the last several months, we have been on our toes, working to make the stadium ready, we thank God that we are ready and I want to commend members of the local organising committee for their commitment to see that everything is in place for the championship.
“It is a thing of joy that most of our guest have already arrived and from tomorrow August 1, 2018, the championship will commence,” he remarked during the ceremony yesterday. The Chairman of LOC for the championship, Solomon Ogba disclosed that out of the 54 African countries billed to participate in the championship, 52 have already arrived Nigeria.
Ogba stated that the hoisting of the flags signalled, “the commencement of the championship, visitors will enjoy the events and it is worthy to note that championships are hosted by cities, not countries, that is why we have Asaba 2018.” Chairman, Delta State Sports Commission, Chief Tonobok Okowa observed that the hoisting of flags of participating countries was a mark of respect for those countries.
