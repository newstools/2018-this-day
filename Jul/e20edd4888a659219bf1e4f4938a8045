Dealers and Enterprise customers in the South West were the first to taste the goodies at the Sheraton Hotel, Ikeja. On hand to welcome the guests were two iconic comedians, the Bishop of Osusu Ministry, Gordons (Godwin Komone) and Seyi Law (Lawrence Oluwaseyitan Aletile) supported by a one-man band, Aka Melody, who put guests in a relaxed mood for the event. Globacom’s Chief Retail Officer, Mr. David Maji welcomed them to the event on behalf of Dr. Mike Adenuga Jr., Chairman of Globacom. Unlike some events where musical guests are revealed ahead of the show, the audience was taken by surprise to see the juju music maestro, King Sunny Ade (KSA) making a cameo appearance at the event. KSA who looked resplendent in his all-white attire quickly mounted the band stand and sang “Call me…0805 is my number dial” as an appetizing performance to the stakeholders who pulled out their phones to record the rare entertainment gift Glo offered them; an exclusive KSA performance just for them! It was all good food, choice wine and drinks and “ariya unlimited” which sent the guests to the dance floor. As an appreciative token, each guest got a surprise gift of plasma television set, while the evening of fun was rounded off with a raffle draw where some of the stakeholders went home with millions of naira. Simultaneously, Glo Dealers and Enterprise customers in the South-South were also having a great time at the posh Swiss Spirit Hotel on Stadium Road, Port Harcourt. A two-man live band, Soul Plus Band, dished out memorable tunes to put them in the mood. Augustine Mamuro, Regional Manager Secondary Sales (South South Region) welcomed them and it was fun galore as Dan D’Humorous and Arinze Baba tickled guests with witty jokes. Guests in Port Harcourt also won millions of naira prizes.
