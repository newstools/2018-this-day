A Moscow court yesterday handed down a 15-day jail sentence to one of four people who interrupted Sundayâ€™s World Cup final between France and Croatia when they ran onto the pitch wearing fake police uniforms. The judge also banned the pitch invader, Veronika Nikulshina, from attending sports events for three years. Three others are due to be sentenced later yesterday.
