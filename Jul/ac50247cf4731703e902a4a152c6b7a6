A group representing the interest of the Esan land, in Edo Central senatorial district of Edo State, has rejected proposals to site cattle colonies or ranches in the senatorial district. The group in a statement issued at the weekend, said the resolution was upon its observations of what it alleged as the deadly fallouts from the activities of herdsmen in the region and other parts of the country that have given land to the herdsmen. A statement issued on behalf of the group by its interim Chairman, Chief Omochiere Aisagbonhi, the Esogban of Ubiaja, called on the authorities not to contemplate making the senatorial district the location of any cattle colony or ranches for herdsmen. The communiqué read thus: “That Esan people, as a peaceful race with law-abiding citizens, welcome other law-abiding and peace-loving persons who wish to do legitimate and beneficial business in Esanland. “That any business to be so carried out must not be to the detriment of the original inhabitants and owners of the land. “That Esan people have been following events relating to cattle business as carried out by herdsmen in Nigeria. “That Esan people are not unaware of the historical background of cattle and herdsmen businesses in areas that have come persistently under attacks by the herdsmen to the point that the original inhabitants and landowners have been displaced from their ancestral homes. “That in view of the attendant effects of cattle ranching/colony in our immediate, surrounding and external environment in Nigeria,  where farmers and other citizens have been and are being killed, maimed or kidnapped daily  by supposed pastoralists/herdsmen, Esan people say ‘NO’ to any effort for their land or territory to be used for cattle ranching/colony.”
