Francis Sardauna in Katsina A member of the House of Representatives, representing Kankia/Ingawa/Kusada Federal Constituency of Katsina State on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ahmed Babba Kaita, has defeated nine other contestants to emerge as the party’s standard-bearer for Katsina North senatorial by-election by coasting home to victory with 1,723 votes out of 3,879 accredited votes of the delegates. THISDAY reports that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will conduct a by-election to fill the vacancy on August 1st, following the death of Senator Mustapha Bukar who represented the zone. The APC primary for the by-election, which commenced Wednesday midnight, ended at about 1:50 am on Friday. The Returning Officer, Patrick Obahiagbon, who announced the result of the election Friday morning, said Kaita scored 1,723 votes against his colleague at the Green Chamber, Nasiru Sani Zango, who polled 1,474 votes. Responding to the outcome of the election in a telephone interview with THISDAY, the state APC chairman, Shitu Shitu, applauded the delegates for conducting themselves in a peaceful manner during and after the election. According to Shitu, APC in the state will continue to ensure internal democracy while discharging its activities, adding that: “I call on both the winner and those who lost the election to work together as a team towards the success of the party during the by-election.” However, with the emergence of Kaita as APC standard-bearer, he will be contesting against his brother Kabiru Babba Kaita, who also won the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) primary for the by-election recently. The senatorial zone comprises Kankia, Ingawa, Bindawa, Dutsi, Kusada, Mani, Mashi, Baure, Zango, Sandamu, Maiadua and Daura Local Government Areas of the state.
