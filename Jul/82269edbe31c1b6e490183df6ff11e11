By Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo A former national publicity secretary of the defunct National Party of Nigeria (NPN), Chief Abiola Ogundokun, has commended political parties in Osun State for eschewing violence during the conduct of their governorship primaries. He also enjoined them to sustain the peaceful atmosphere in the state, before, during and after the September 22 governorship election. In a statement he personally signed and made available to newsmen on Tuesday, he said the peaceful primaries conducted by political parties, especially the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) showed that “our mentality about election has changed for good”. He called on the candidates that emerged at the primaries not to see their co-contestants as losers, but rather, work with them to emerge victorious in the coming election. The elder statesman, who also advised politicians to play the game according to the rules, stressed that election is not a do or die affair. “I congratulate the winners in the primary election held recently in the state. The peaceful conduct of the primaries is a good omen for the upcoming governorship election. “I want to advise politicians to sustain the peace and play the game according to the rules. Election should not be do or die. “The co-contestants of the winners should give priority to the love of people and their party. They need to support the candidate that emerged for the success of their party in the coming election. “The people of the state should also ensure that they elect a credible, competent, capable, intellectual and matured candidate come September 22. “Money should not be a determinant for electing a candidate in the coming governorship election, but exposure, talent and experience to lead the state to a greater level,” he said.
