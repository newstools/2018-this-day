Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti After emerging victorious in last Saturday’s governorship election, the Ekiti State Governor-elect, Dr. Kayode Fayemi , wednesday received Certificates of Return from the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC). Speaking after being presented with the Certificate of Return as the governor-elect at the INEC office in Ado Ekiti, the state capital, Fayemi promised to unite the Ekiti people and offer credible governance that would alleviate the poverty of the populace. The INEC’s National Commissioner in charge of Oyo, Ekiti and Osun States, Prince Adedeji Soyebi, presented Fayemi with the Certificate of Return at the ceremony. The Deputy Governor-elect, Otunba Bisi Egbeyemi, also received his Certificate of Return. The governor-elect commended the electoral body for doing what he described as an “excellent job” of conducting the governorship poll. Contrary to the claim of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Fayemi contended that the election which returned him as winner was “seamless, free, fair, credible and violence-free.” The governor-elect noted that INEC should be commended for conducting a process of 14 steps, which climaxed with the presentation of the Certificate of Return. Fayemi stressed that INEC did a good job in delivering the election in a credible and professional manner despite fears being expressed in the build-up to the poll. He also commended the security agencies for providing security back-up, which gave the electorate confidence to come out and exercise their franchise. The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Prof. AbdulGaniy Raji, expressed delight that the election was held despite the tension that preceded it. Raji commended the people of Ekiti State for the maturity displayed before during and after the election which he was successful. In his remarks, Soyebi noted that the presentation of Certificate of Return marked the end of the process of the Ekiti governorship election.
