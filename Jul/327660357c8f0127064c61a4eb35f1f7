Omololu Ogunmade in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari Tuesday said he wished members of the National Assembly who defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) well, saying he remained committed to the values of democracy and freedom of choice. In a statement, Malam Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, said the president, in his reaction to the defection, noted that none of the defecting federal lawmakers of the APC had any specific grievances against him or the government he leads, neither did he harbour anything against any of them. He quoted him as saying, “As the saying goes, all politics is local. We understand that some of the distinguished and honourable lawmakers have issues with their home states, especially on zoning which bars some of them from seeking another term in their constituencies.” The statement also said Buhari argued that the APC had done its best to halt the defections. He commended the leadership of the party for relentlessly working for its unity and ensuring success in the upcoming elections. It added that Buhari assured members of the APC of his total support and urged party faithful not to despair but to rather see the defections as a seasonal occurrence that happens on election eve. “He expressed confidence that no harm or injury will be done to the party and its aspirations by the movements. President Buhari wished all the decamped members the best in their future undertakings,” the statement added.
