The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Thursday said its attention had been drawn to the activities of fraudsters impersonating some of its principal officers in an attempt to defraud unsuspecting members of the public. Specifically, the central bank in a statement signed by its acting Director, Corporate Communications, Isaac Okorafor, stated that of particular concern was a recent message sent from an e-mail purportedly belonging to its Deputy Governor, Corporate Services, Mr. Edward Lametek Adamu, transacting a phony business deal. It therefore warned members of the public, particularly members of the social media community that its officials do not communicate with emails outside the @cbn.gov.ng domain. “No principal officer of the Bank will transact business or ask you to transact business with any other platform outside those ending with @cbn.gov.ng . “The CBN also wishes to warn the public that it will not be liable for any financial transaction which may have transpired between people and scammers who have created emails or social media accounts in the name of principal officers of the Central Bank of Nigeria. “For the avoidance of doubt, the Central Bank of Nigeria maintains only the social media platforms as listed on the CBN website, www.cbn.gov.ng “If in doubt about the authenticity of an email, document or telephone conversation purportedly coming from or on behalf of the CBN, please send an email query to contactcbn@cbn.gov.ng or call +2347002255226 before taking any action in relation to the correspondence,” it added. Accordingly, the Bank urged all members of the public to desist from transacting business with imposters, saying doing so would be at their own risk.
