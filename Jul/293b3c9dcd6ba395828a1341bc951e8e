Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) not to allow the Presidency to coerce it into covering the NYSC certificate forgery case against the Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, with a purported investigation. The party said it is instructive for NYSC to note that all issues in the news report that Mrs. Adeosun forged her NYSC Exemption Certificate as well as reports that the Presidency is mounting pressure on NYSC to cover up for the minister are already in the public domain. In a statement issued by PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said Nigerians are closely monitoring the issue and the public is already aware of the pressure on the NYSC leadership to announce a misplacement of relevant files and other excuses to achieve a dead end in the investigation. “The NYSC must therefore know that its reputation is highly at stake as Nigerians are already agitated over the questionable delay by the Corps in coming out with an answer on a direct issue that requires a simple computer or even manual file check at its headquarters. “Indeed, a simple process of matching the serial numbering, date and authorizing signature on Mrs. Adeosun’s certificate does not require a lengthy investigation or the current shenanigan going on at the NYSC headquarters. “NYSC is advised to have in mind that in this age of global Information Communication Technology (ICT), there is nothing anybody can do to suppress or distort facts, even in the public service. Any attempt to cover up will invoke the wrath of Nigerians and irredeemably rubbish the integrity and respect the Corps has earned over the years,” it said. PDP further said that NYSC must not allow its reputation to be dragged in the mud by the discredited All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration that has become notorious for concealment of fraud and sharp practices by its officials.
