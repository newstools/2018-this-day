Revenues at La Liga winner Barcelona hit a record €914m (£809m) in the 2017-18 season, the club has said. The Spanish football giant also said it was on track to achieve revenues of €1bn by 2021. Barcelona received a world record transfer fee of £200.6m from Paris St Germain for Brazilian Neymar in 2017. Since then the Catalan club has twice broken its transfer record on the signings of Ousmane Dembele (£96.8m) and Philippe Coutinho (£106.4m). Operating profits at the club were €32m, while the net profit was €13m. “The board has valued the final balance of the year positively, and it’s in line with the strategic plan of the club to reach €1,000m of income in 2021,” the club said. As well as reclaiming the La Liga title from rivals Real Madrid during 2017-18, the club also won the Copa del Rey for a fourth successive season. But they were knocked out of the Champions League by Italy’s Roma at the quarter-final stage.
