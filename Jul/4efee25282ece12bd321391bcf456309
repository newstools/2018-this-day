The Nigeria Football Federation said on Friday that it had noted some media reports arising from a BBC documentary involving the Chief Coach of the Super Eagles, Mr. Salisu Yusuf. “For now, the NFF has commenced preliminary investigation into the matter to assist the Committee on Ethics and Fairplay,” NFF’s Director of Communications, Ademola Olajire, said. BBC had shown a video showing Yusuf taking bribe from men posing as football agents to two Nigerian players. The footage was captured by Ghanaian journalist, Anas Aremeyew Anas, in September 2017 and was broadcast by BBC Africa Eye.
