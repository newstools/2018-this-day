THEME: Funding Healthcare for ALL: Why States Matter. The two previous editions have focused on the chronic underfunding of the health sector as a major cause of poor health outcomes. The efforts have been part of the successful advocacy towards the appropriation of the Basic Healthcare Provision Fund in the 2018 budget by the National Assembly. In this edition, we shall be focusing on the importance of states in the equation by honouring high performing states using a set of verifiable and objective indicators provided by the FMOH Saving one million lives initiative program to determine such high performing states. WHO COULD ATTEND? During this edition of the policy dialogue, we will honor high performing states in several categories. We will have in attendance State Governors, members of the Federal Executive Council, state Commissioners of health, SPHCDAs, development partners, high level dignitaries from the public and private sector, stakeholders and members of the general public.
