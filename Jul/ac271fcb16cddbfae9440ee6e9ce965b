The senator representing Kogi West at the National Assembly, Dino Melaye, has resurfaced, saying that he has regained his freedom from his alleged abductors. Melaye, who announced his freedom via his twitter handle, said he spent 11 hours in the wilderness. He said: “I thank God once again for escaping another dangerous attack. I also thank Nigerians for their prayers and show of Love. Spent 11 hours in the wilderness traumatized but God preserved me. God is the best and in whom ONLY I trust. They will continue to try. WE SHALL OVERCOME.”
