The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has tasked religious leaders in the country to play active role in grooming God-fearing leaders who will provide credible leadership for the future. Obaseki made the request on Friday in Benin City, at the Men’s Ministries Convention 2018 organised by the Assemblies of God Nigeria, Edo District, themed: “Men, His Agent of His Glory.” He described the convention as a good ground for leaders of the church to pray for Nigeria to overcome her challenges, adding, “The major problem this country is facing is that of leadership, as most of our past leaders failed us as a country. “The country is where it is now because of bad leadership. At a time in our history, Nigeria was the largest producer of palm oil. God has specially blessed Nigeria in terms of climate and other natural resources across all parts of the country.” He maintained that spiritual leaders have an important role to play in praying for the country and contributing to political and economic development, among others. In his remark, the Church District Superintendent, Rev. Paul Ekeasi, assured that Nigeria would experience good leadership in the country. Ekeasi offered prayers for Nigeria’s economy to experience a boom that would reduce the level of unemployment in the country. He urged spiritual leaders to ensure they offer prayers for the peaceful coexistence of Nigerians, irrespective of tribe or other considerations.
