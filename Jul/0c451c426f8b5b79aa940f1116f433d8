By Senator Iroegbu in Abuja The Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation Lafiya Dole has killed several Boko Haram Terrorists at Bulagaye and Kwakwa areas of Borno State. The Director of Public Relations and Information (DOPRI), Air Vice Marshal Olatokunbo Adesanya said in a statement yesterday that the successful air strikes on both locations were a result of efforts to trail and neutralise fleeing terrorists after Nigerian Army  troops had repelled the attack on their location around Bama. Adesanya said upon receiving reports of the attack, the ATF scrambled Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform and the Alpha Jet aircraft to locate the fleeing terrorists. Consequently, he said the insurgents, who were seen assembling at a staging area in Bulagaye began to disperse upon sighting the attack platforms. “However, the NAF fighter aircraft acquired and attacked the fleeing insurgents with bombs and rockets. As a result of the air strikes, the terrorists were neutralised while their vehicles and weapons were destroyed, leading to a thick cloud of black smoke,” he stated. According to Adesanya, intelligence reports later revealed that a smaller bunch of the terrorists had re-assembled in a settlement known as Kwakwa with the ATF conducting a wave of strikes on the location. He said the ISR platform successfully identified the terrorists’ location and vectored the attack platforms to the target area, which was attacked with bombs and rockets. The NAF Spokesman also said that some of the terrorists were seen fleeing towards a nearby settlement and further attacked with rockets and then neutralised. He promised that the Air Task Force would continue to conduct missions in support of the efforts of our troops in the counterinsurgency operations in the Northeast while also providing Close Air Support when requested to do so.
