Seriki Adinoyi in Jos The Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong has expressed hope that he would no longer swear in caretaker chairmen for any local government areas in the state, adding that the next swearing-in will be for elected local government chairmen as he is looking forward to conduct council elections soon. The governor noted this on Tuesday when he swore in the appointed caretaker Chairman of Kanan Local Government Area of the state, Alhaji Hudu Musa Sarki, at the Rayfield Government House, Jos. He said: “Our Rescue Administration is mindful of the limited time at her disposal as against the great expectation of the people of Plateau State. You are therefore coming in at a very critical period for immediate service delivery to the people of Kanam in particular and the state in general. I expect therefore that you will hit the ground running, with practical solutions that will sustain the confidence of citizens in government, by closing up the socio-economic gap in Kanam Local Government Area within your limited time in office. “Your responsibility is to reinforce this commitment with efficient service delivery and to ensure that all components of our Five Policy Thrust are given effect within the shortest possible time. I am sure you have familiarised yourself with the policy direction of our government and you are fully prepared to drive the process of its realisation within your local government area.” Charging Sarki, the governor said: “In this season of the conscious campaign for probity and accountability, you must avoid the temptation to compromise on your integrity; strive to be incorruptible and to maintain the highest level of discipline, work ethics and responsible management of resources, so that you can better the lot of our people as part of your value addition to good governance.” Responding, Sarki thanked the governor for giving him the rare opportunity to serve his people, promising to unite the APC supporters in the local government into one voice to work for the re-election of Lalong and President Muhammadu Buhari in the next general election.
