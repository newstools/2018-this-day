Neobong Okon-Ekong Following the defection of 14 senators and 37 House of Representatives members from the All Progressives Congress (APC), the party has urged its members across the country to remain calm as 25 of the 36 states are still under its firm control. APC acknowledged that its leadership was aware of the growing discontent among its members and had initiated moves, albeit, unsuccessful to address the concerns of the agitated persons. APC’s National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi, said, “In the last couple of weeks our party leaders worked to stave off this situation as responsible party leaders would do. It would appear, however, that the individuals involved have different considerations beyond the grievances that they were willing to discuss and which our leaders were willing to address.” Abdullahi alluded to the party’s widespread support around the country and expressed confidence it will retain its majority status in 25 out of 36 states of the federation. He said, “We assured members and supporters that our great party will continue to consolidate on our majority status in the lead up to the 2019 general elections, even as our government continues to work hard to deliver on our promises to Nigerians.” According to the APC spokesman, having failed to rein in the disgruntled members, it was left with no other choice than to respect their constitutional right to freedom of association. He said, “As a truly democratic party, we respect the right of every citizen to political association. Therefore, we urge our members to remain calm as we continue to work hard to position our party strongly for the next general elections. APC remains in firm control of 25 states of the 36 states of the federation and maintains a clear majority in the federal House of Representatives and state assemblies.”
