Kings College Class of 88 , will on July 27, inaugurate three of the projects it donated to the school, just as it begin its commemorative events to mark the 30th anniversary of its graduation from the college. A member of the organising committee, Mr. Olumide Akpata who spoke on the programmes, noted that the three-day event, will begin with a ‘Back-to-School’ lunch and a symposium themed, ‘The Kings College Conundrum: Where Do We Go From Here?” is aimed at giving back to the school while throwing light on the issues of decay vis-à-vis educational and infrastructural development in the country. The Class of 82 to 88, had last year raised and deployed N15 million for the redesign and refurbishment of the college’s waste management facility due to inadequacies of the waste disposal system designed for a far smaller school population. The project, funded by the class in commemoration of their 30th anniversary graduation from the college, is one of three projects to be launched. Another member of the organising committee, Emeka Oragwu, said the overriding sentiment behind the donation was the opportunity it afforded the group to express its gratitude to the college. “Our successes in life are thanks to the solid intellectual and social foundation we received at King’s College. What better way to express our thanks than by giving something back to the school?” he said. As part of the activities lined up for the three-day event is a live performance of Dike Chukwumerije’s ‘Made in Nigeria’, a 120 minute depiction of 102 years of Nigeria’s history through poetry, dance and drama at the Assembly Hall, King’s College, Lagos. Other activities include a health and wellness seminar on July 28, 2018; sports and fun day; as well as an anniversary dinner and Gala Nite to wrap the day up. The anniversary celebrations will officially close with a thanksgiving service at ‘The Dome’, This Present House in Lagos, followed by a Luncheon on the Prest Lunch Cruise.
