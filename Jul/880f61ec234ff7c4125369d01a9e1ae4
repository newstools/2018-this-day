Super Eagles forward, Victor Moses, has returned from his short vacation after the World Cup to join his Chelsea first team mates in training ahead of the 2018-2019 season. Chelsea confirmed the return of Moses and others at their Cobham training groun. Other Russia 2018 participants who were in camp yesterday include; César Azpilicueta, Willy Caballero and Antonio Rüdiger. Moses was not in Chelsea’s 25-man traveling squad for the tour of Australia last Wednesday as he had not returned to work before Maurizio Sarri named the roster. The Italian manager will certainly make an adjustment to Moses’s position in the new season as he is expected to lineup in a 4-3-3 system, meaning the Nigerian will play either as a right winger or right fullback, the latter looking unlikely as he has more offensive qualities. With the Super Eagles dazzler back in training, he has come into contention to make the squad list for Saturday’s International Champions Cup match against Internazionale in Nice. It will become clear whether Kenneth Omeruo, Ola Aina, Fikayo Tomori and Tammy Abraham are in the plans of manager Maurizio Sarri for the forthcoming season when the squad is announced later today.
