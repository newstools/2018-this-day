 In commemoration of the International Level Crossing Awareness Day (ILCAD), last month, motorists and pedestrians have been advised to be cautious when using the level crossings in the country. This advice was given by the Nigeria Coordinator of the ILCAD, who is also the Managing Editor of Transport Day newspaper, Mr. Frank Kintum at the Yaba, Lagos level crossing where handbills were distributed to motorists and pedestrians. Handbills and stickers were also distributed to motorists and pedestrians at Jibowu, Mushin, Ikeja, among others. The theme of the message to stakeholders was –‘Look and Listen before you use the level crossings’. According to Kintum, the advice was imperative following disturbing reports of accidents and deaths recorded in some level crossings across the country. Kintum, who commended the Nigerian Railway Corporation for its efforts at ensuring safer train transportation in the country, called on all stakeholders like the Federal Road Safety Corps, Police, etc to improve their road road/rail safety drives. In her message to Nigeria, ILCAD’s Project Officer, Isabelle Fonverne, stated that “the causes of collisions at level crossings can be very different, but it is recognised that human behaviour is the main factor for road collisions. “The vast majority of collisions at level/grade crossings are caused by drivers not observing the Highway Code, whether deliberately or unintentionally. Drivers’ errors can result from tiredness, stress, consumption of pharmaceutical products or other substances, or simply from going too fast – but they can also be caused by the inappropriate use of electronic devices”. The ILCAD is marked every year, and this year’s edition was on June 7.
