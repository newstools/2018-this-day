James Emejo in Abuja The House of Representatives Thursday passed a motion mandating its ad-hoc committee investigating the huge debts owed by the International Oil Companies (IOCs) to indigenous contractors to extend its functions to the processes of Marginal Oil Fields Licence acquisition. It will also evaluate the financial proceeds from successful bids, remittance and non-remittance of revenues by the licensed operators into the Federation Accounts. The probe will also look at the strategic alliance agreements between IOCs, investors and the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company in the operations of the oilfields. The resolution of the lower chamber followed a motion moved under matters of urgent public importance by Hon. Diri Douye (PDP, Bayelsa) on the urgent need to launch investigation into the oil and gas fields from 2001 to 2017. He expressed concern that more than a decade after award of the first marginal fields’ Oil Mining Leases (OML), the combined production volume of the MFOs were yet to make any significant impact in the Nigerian oil and gas industry and currently accounting for less than four percent of the country’s crude oil output according to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). He further noted that the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) had in 2014 indicated that the marginal oil field licences awarded to indigenous companies in 2003 but which were yet to be developed by their owners will be revoked. He said one year after, the DPR was yet to carry out the planned revocation of licences. Among other things, Douye said the precarious situation had resulted in huge revenue losses to the Federation Accounts from the lease holders’ royalties, taxes and other financial proceeds accruable from the operations of the marginal oil fields.
