Oshiomhole was less restrained in his response to the defections Tuesday, describing the estranged members as big masquerades without electoral values. According to him, Nigerians will go to the poll very soon and the outcome will reveal clearly that the defectors do not constitute any threat to APC, alleging that defectors are those who cannot adjust to the change being championed by the APC government. He said the business of governance should be driven by men and women of honour and not by those who are more pre-occupied with personal interests, adding that the earlier such persons took their exit from the party the better. “The business of governance must be driven by men and women of honour. If it’s about ‘me,’ the earlier those pursuing personal gains leave the better. We will go for campaign… These people, the votes they got in 2015, and the president got more votes from their constituencies. There were big masquerades with no electoral value,” Oshiomhole stated. The party’s National Publicity, Abdullahi, tried to calm nerves, saying despite the defections the party was still in the majority. In a statement, he said apart from being in control of 25 out of the 36 states of the federation, APC maintained a clear majority in the federal House of Representatives and state assemblies. According to him, “As a truly democratic party, we respect the right of every citizen to political association. Therefore, we urge our members to remain calm as we continue to work hard to position our party strongly for the next general elections. “APC remains in firm control of 25 states of the 36 states of the federation and maintains a clear majority in the federal House of Representatives and state assemblies.”
