By Kas Sumaina in Abuja The Minister of Transportation, Mr. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, on Friday said he was confident that  President Muhammadu Buhari would win 2019 presidential election, noting specifically two states in the north  – Bauchi and Sokoto  – where he said the President can never be defeated. He said Buhari would win election in Bauchi even on a sickbed and boasted that the President would win in Sokoto even if Governor Aminu Tambuwal defects to another party. Speaking on the sidelines of his inspection tour of the Itakpe-Ajaokuta-Warri rail line, Amaechi, who noted the gale of defections in the ruling All Progressives Congress and speculations that some prominent APC members in the North will dump the party, asked a rhetorical question: Do you honestly believe that the president will lose election in this country? The minister said: “No matter what you do, the governor of Sokoto will leave naturally as he has ambition to be president. “You take a chicken to him, he will still go, right? The same with Kwara, these are people you expect that they will leave. Ok, they left with some members of House Reps and Senate, where did they come from? “They came from areas the president is comfortable. Do you honestly believe that the president will lose election in this country? “Well, nobody is God, but that is one of his comfort zones. The next person that left, left from Bauchi, if you bring president on a sick bed in Bauchi he will win. He has never lost election in Bauchi.” Details later….
