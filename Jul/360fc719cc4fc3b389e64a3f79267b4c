By Vanessa Obioha with agency reports Following the news that Meghan Markle’s half-sister, Samantha, was tipped to appear on Celebrity Big Brother on Channel 5, British broadcasters, ITV and BBC reportedly banned relatives of the actress from featuring in reality TV shows for fear of embarrassing the Royal Family. The networks decision, a source said is to avoid anti-Royal remarks. “The BBC do not want to host someone on Strictly who would be so anti the Royal Family. And ITV’s top brass feel they would not give a voice to these people.” Some of the shows they are banned from include ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ and ‘I’m a Celebrity’.
