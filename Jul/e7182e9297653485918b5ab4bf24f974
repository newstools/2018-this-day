In an obvious riot-reading mode, the new national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, last week called out the two Ministers of Labour and Aviation, Dr. Chris Ngige and Hadi Sirika, over alleged poor handling of their ministries. He threatened to deal with them by recommending their sack to the president, except, of course, they buckled down. Now, that is the quintessential Oshiomhole, a man with short temper, who is now burdened with the responsibility of overseeing a party with grappling wih internal wrongdoing tendencies. It was not just that he called out the duo; he equally sent a subliminal message to President Muhammadu Buhari with uncultured subtlety. “…And if the President condones disrespect for his office, I will not condone disrespect for the party,” he was quoted as saying. The reason Oshiomhole became the choice candidate for the office was because of the 2019 elections. They party leadership thought they needed a ‘general’ to lead the party in the 2019 and the lot fell on him as a former labour leader. But his assignment does not include disintegrating the party. With elections inching closer with tension in the land, Oshiomhole cannot afford to exacerbate the situation. He is clearly not acting in a way that will make the election of the president any easy.
