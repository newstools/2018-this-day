If a soothsayer had told Senator Iyiola Omisore last year that Senator Ademola Adeleke would someday become a spoke in the wheel of his political ambition, he would have dismissed it with a wave of the hand. Omisore was said to have played a major role in the election of Adeleke into the upper chamber of the National Assembly. However, in a twist of fate, Adeleke, the Ede, Osun State- born Senator representing Osun East senatorial District, will fly the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) flag in the September 22, 2018 governorship election, while Omisore, a former deputy governor of the state, is the standard bearer of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the election. Since Omisore was allegedly frustrated out of the PDP by Adeleke and his cohorts, they have both been engaging in mudslinging as they pursue their political ambitions. Speaking with Society Watch, a source described Adeleke as a traitor, saying, “Nobody would have expected things to fall apart so soon between the two PDP stalwarts based on Omisore’s participation in his victory just a year ago. I think it is too early for Senator Adeleke to betray the former deputy considering his role in his journey to the Senate.” Another source disclosed that Omisore’s career is heading for the rock as many of his supporters have abandoned him.
