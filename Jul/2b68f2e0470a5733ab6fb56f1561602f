Farouk Lawan is one politician many would not forget in a hurry. He was a four-term member of the House of Representatives for the Bagwai/Shanono Federal Constituency of Kano State. While he was in the lower chamber of the National Assembly, he was always in the news. Sadly, Lawan, famously described as Mr. Integrity, exited the exalted chamber in a very controversial circumstance when he was alleged to have collected a $620 million bribe from the oil and gas magnate, Femi Otedola. The ugly development became a big blot on his political career. Since then, he is said to be striving very hard to regain relevance in the political circle. However, the more he tries, the more he gets stuck. The diminutive politician, without a worry about his already dented image, reportedly attempted to return to the lower chamber in 2015 for the fifth time, but he was trounced and humiliated by a greenhorn, Sule Aliyu Romo; a proof that his influence has totally withered. It was also gathered that he recently nursed the ambition of contesting the governorhip election in Kano. However, the ambition died even at gestation. ‘‘Lawan’s supporters and friends have allegedly abandoned him, and he might have gone into political oblivion forever,’’ a source said. Another source that although he appears to have gone underground since he left the House in 2015, Lawan is said to be trying seriously to bounce back and contest the same seat come 2019.
