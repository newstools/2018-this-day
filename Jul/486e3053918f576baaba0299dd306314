Addressing shareholders at the annual general meeting (AGM), Chairman of the company, Mrs. Omobola Johnson observed that after a moderate growth in the previous year, global economy witnessed steady improvement in 2017 on the back of accommodative monetary and fiscal policies as well as robust global trade. According to her, following the meltdown of the stock market and the relatively low interest rate regime of 2016, the environment in 2017 was more favourable to companies with net investible funds such as Custodian and Allied Plc among others. She said the various revenue streams including premium income, investment income, fees and commission recorded significant growth while the companyâ€™s costs were effectively managed, resulting in a 37 percent increase in the net profit of N7.3 billion in 2017 compared with N5.3 billion and comprehensive income of N8.02 billion compared with N5.04 billion in the corresponding period of 2016. On the future outlook, the chairman noted that in spite of the uncertainty that usually accompanied election cycles in Nigeria, she was confident that the management was well- positioned and adept enough to weather the storm and continue to take the company to greater heights.
