*Adjourns plenary till Sept 26 By Deji Elumoye Senator Iroegbu in Abuja The Senate on Tuesday asked the security operatives laying siege to the Apo residence of the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, to vacate the premises. This is sequel to a motion of urgent national importance moved by Senator Chukwuka Utasi (Enugu East) complaining about the invasion of the house of Ekweremadu by both Police and EFCC operatives since the early hours of Tuesday. He said as early as 5am, security personnel stormed Ekweremadu’s residence and didn’t allow people to go in or out of the house. Senate President Bukola Saraki, who presided, while summarising the prayer of the Senate after taking contributions from some senators who decried the siege,  asked the security operatives to vacate the premises of Ekweremadu immediately. He also adjourned plenary until September 26. Senator Barnabas Gemade in an addendum said since the Senate will be going on an eight-week vacation, it will be necessary for senators to consider and approve the votes and proceedings for Tuesday’s plenary before the recess. At this point, the Senate Leader asked that the Senate adjourned sitting for 30 minutes to consider the votes and proceedings of the plenary.  Details later…
