With the Ekiti State governorship election taken off the calendar, Osun State taken is rocking with politicking and electioneering its ahead of September 22. Like the Ekiti election typified by high stakes, Osun governorship election promises to be more politically engaging, first, because of the inter-play of interests within the two leading parties and second, the inter-parties’ fireworks. Already, candidates of the major parties have emerged and typically, the election is going to be a two-horse race between the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC). While the PDP is fielding Senator Ademola Adeleke, APC has sent forward former Chief of Staff to outgoing Governor Rauf Aregbesola, Mr. Gboyega Oyebola. Therefore, with everything seemingly set for the exercise, lessons learnt from the Ekiti election must not be lost in Osun especially, the cankerworm of vote-buying which both parties were accused of. It was unfortunate to note that despite the fact that the election was generally free and fair, it suffered credibility deficit. This is why Osun must transcend this ugly practice. All hand must be on deck – INEC, security personnel, political parties and the candidates. This is important because the election is the last major one to be conducted before the 2019 elections (apart from about six pending by-elections) and in many ways than one, it would signpost expectations in 2019 in terms of preparations by all concerned. This, unfortunately, the Ekiti election could not ascertain and should Osun fail too, it might as well be that the 2019 elections are doomed already. Thus, those saddled with the responsibility of ensuring a peaceful election must deliver excuses.
