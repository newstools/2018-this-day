Aftermath of his ‘brilliant’ debut for Super Eagles of Nigeria at the last World Cup finals in Russia, Francis Odinaka Uzoho, has threatened to leave his current Spanish club, Deportivo La Coruna unless they can meet his conditions. According to owngoalnigeria.com, the young Nigerian goal stopper will probably leave relegated LaLiga side before the end of the current transfer window if his conditions are not met. Uzoho is unhappy with the club as they are yet to confirm him as first choice ahead of the start of the season with coach Natxo Gonzalez insisting on maintaining him as third choice goalkeeper, something that hasn’t gone down well with Uzoho. The soon to be 20 years old feels alternating between the first team and the second team who are in the third division is a step down from the height of representing Nigeria at the World Cup, where he was up against some of the best players in the world. However the coach explained that the Nigerian isn’t quite what he wants as his first choice as he doesn’t play with his legs like one of his goalkeepers Adrian Ortola, and not as experienced as new signing Dani Gimenez. Coupled with the fact that the second division in Spain is not in accordance with the FIFA window for international games, making Uzoho who is sure to be involved with Nigeria in their race to qualify for the 2019 African Cup of Nations first choice could be counter productive as he might be away for crucial games. In order to protect his international career Uzoho is now thinking of other options and he is exploring a move away from the club and some teams in Europe are already in talks with him representatives over a deal possibly a loan deal. Uzoho at the last World Cup finals conceded four goals in three matches including the one by Lionel Messi in the 2-1 win by the Argentina in the last group D match at Saint Pertersburg.
