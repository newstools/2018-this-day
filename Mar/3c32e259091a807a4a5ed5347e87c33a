Laleye Dipo in Minna Former Minister of Information, Professor Jerry Gana, is believed to still be a member of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) contrary to the claim that he and other stalwarts of the party last week defected to the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Indication to this effect emerged in Minna on Wednesday during the expanded State Working Committee (SWC) meeting of the party held at the state secretariat. The meeting was presided over by the state Chairman of the party, Alhaji Tanko Beji, with other prominent members of the party including ex- Governor Muazu Babangida Aliyu in attendance. The meeting was primarily called to approve nominations from the three zones for membership of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the party. Professor Jerry Gana was said to be a life member of the BoT.
It was learnt that delegates from Niger south senatorial zone, the zone where Gana hails from, informed the meeting that the vocal and foundation member of the PDP still had his name on the register of the party in Busu ward.
The delegates said Gana had also not sent his resignation letter to the party as expected by law. As a result, no new nomination was accepted for the position of life member of BoT for the area. The meeting however set up a seven-man committee to meet with the former minister to find out his position on the matter. In the meantime, Aliyu was unanimously endorsed as a BoT member for Niger East senatorial zone while Alhaji Abubakar Tanko Achituo, a former minister beat two others – Alhaji Aminu Isa Kontagora and Senator Nuhu Aliyu – to clinch the seat for the Niger North senatorial zone. Their names would be forwarded to the national secretariat of the party soon.
