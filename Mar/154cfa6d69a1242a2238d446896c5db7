Indeed, like bloomed fables and flowers on furze, the 72nd birthday of one of the alpha-female politicians in Nigeria, Florence, was grand. Political associates, friends and family thronged the venue, her Bellavista, Banana Island, Ikoyi home, like a flock of sheep responding to the shepherdâ€™s summons.
