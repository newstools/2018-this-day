Omolou Ogunmade in Abuja
Vice-President Namadi Sambo on Tuesday paid a visit to President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja. Sambo, who was the vice-president in the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan and a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), was visiting the president for the first time since he left office in 2015. Although it was not the first time the former vice-president would visit the Presidential Villa since he left office, it was the first time he would meet the president in either a closed-door or open meeting in the Villa.
He had last year, visited Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo and held a closed-door meeting with the president for over an hour. Yesterdayâ€™s visit with the president lasted for only 30 minutes. Details of his meeting with the president was unknown as the former vice-president declined to speak with journalists who had waited for him while the meeting lasted.
