Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City The Governor of Edo State, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has urged members of the Edo State House of Assembly to expedite work on the bill for a law to prohibit trafficking in persons and establish the Edo State Task Force against Trafficking in Persons. The Bill which was sent to the EDHA in January, is part of government’s efforts to institutionalise the fight against human trafficking in the state. According to Obaseki, “The state government has adopted a multipronged approach which includes a law, aggressive campaigns at markets and across the broad spectrum of the media, stakeholder engagements, partnerships with the National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) and international governments and bodies, in tackling the menace.” He also appealed to the lawmakers to accelerate action on the Bill for the establishment of the Edo State Development and Property Agency which the governor said will revolutionise the state’s housing sector. “The state government envisions a robust housing sector with huge private sector investment that will address the housing and infrastructural deficit in the state. We are ready to replicate best practices in the built industry to ensure that standards in the industry are adhered to across the value chain,” he said. The first reading of the EDPA Bill was read on the floor of the house last Monday, after which it was referred to the House Committee on Infrastructure and Rules, Business and Government House for further legislative input. Similarly, the EDHA had earlier commenced the clause-by-clause consideration of the Bill for a Law to prohibit trafficking in persons and establish the Edo State Task Force Against Trafficking in Persons.
