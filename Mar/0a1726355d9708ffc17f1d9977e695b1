Emmanuel Addeh in Yenagoa A member of the National Assembly representing Yenagoa/Kolokuma/Opokuma federal constituency, Douye Diri, and his counterpart at the state level, representing Yenagoa constituency III, Gentle Emelah, have called on the federal government to come to the aid of communities affected by flooding in Bayelsa. Also, Diri who led a delegation to Biseni Community in the Yenagoa, following last week’s destruction caused by the downpour and attendant flooding urged the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and oil multinationals to wade in and help the displaced. Many were rendered homeless while residential houses, church buildings, farm lands, electric poles and cables were destroyed during the hours of severe flooding. Diri said that a team of property evaluators would be engaged immediately to assess and analyse the impact of the rainstorm, stressing that the evaluation of the destruction was an urgent action to guide anyone or groups coming with support and relief materials. “When I get back to Abuja, I will raise my voice on this natural disaster by a motion on the floor. The world needs to know what has befallen our people. I also call on the government of President Muhammadu Buhari, to respond immediately to this disaster and to all others that happened across the country. That is what government should do,” he said.
Many Indigenes, who spoke maintained that no form of emergency relief had been provided in the oil-rich community a week after the incident. In his remarks, Emelah a member of the State House of Assembly, noted that he was glad that no life was lost, saying that there was the need to restore electricity in the community immediately. “The only consolation is that no life was lost. You have seen the colossal damage, the level of impact on the life of the people. My appeal is for NEMA to immediately come to the aid of the people. Also, the State Emergency Agency should step in”, he said.
