 A food festival themed “Nigerian Flavours” is making its debut this week in Abuja. Aimed at showcasing the rich culinary diversity of Nigerian cuisine and delicacies, the festival is an initiative of the Ministry of Information and Culture, in collaboration with the Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC), National Institute of Hospitality and Tourism (NIHOTOUR) and the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) in line with the objectives of the “Tour Nigeria”. “Tour Nigeria” is a brand of the NTDC, which was conceived to drive domestic consumption of Nigeria’s tourism assets and products, create new channels of tourism markets, generate employment and increase spending in the economy. It also aims at promoting domestic and international tourism to Nigeria by ensuring that the nation takes advantage of her population, its density, its wealth and its unique culture. Highlights of the historic event, slated to hold at Harrow Park, Wuse 2, Abuja, FCT on Saturday, (March 17) include participation of over 60 food and beverage vendors across the six geo-political zones, musical performance by Nigerian Artists, merchandizing opportunities for arts, crafts and fashion, safe children’s games area, affordable farmers’ market, great comedy and more. According to the NTDC, Nigerian Flavours promises to showcase the diverse gastronomy of Nigeria and promote Abuja as a destination for fun, hospitality and relaxation.
