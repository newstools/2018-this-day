With barely two weeks and the countdown to Gidi Culture Festival 2018 in full swing, the event organizers have added more names to the already stacked line-up. March 30 promises to be a Good Friday at Hard Rock Café Beach Front, Landmark, Oniru-Lagos. The diverse heavy hitting line-up now includes Dj Spinall, Ric Hassani, Ghanaian Songstress, Efya, Tay Iwar, Odunsi, while the duo of Spanky and Jess will host the show. Speaking on the line-up of artistes, Chin Okeke, one of the founders of Gidi Fest explained that “it had to be special for our fifth edition and we wanted to make sure there was something for everybody”. This year, the organizers have introduced the Next Gen Stage, which they will be curating and promoting in partnership with Universal Music. “The stage serves as an ode to a very progressive movement of young determined creatives who aren’t taking no for an answer and challenging the status quo. So it’s only makes sense that they have their platform,” said Okeke.
