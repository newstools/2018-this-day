Mary Ekah As a tradition, the First Born Family, Region 19 of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) has always marked its anniversary every year with a programme tagged, Power Conference. This year once more, the church will be holding the annual event on Sunday March 18, at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos. But this year’s edition is going to be remarkable as it will be commemorating the 30th year existence of the RCCG parish. Running on the theme, ‘Glory to Glory’, Special Assistant to the General Overseer (Mission), Pastor Brown Oyitso, during a press conference to announce the extraordinary event, said, “Last year, the theme of the Power Conference was the ‘The Turning Point’ and undoubtedly, God has turned things around in the lives, businesses, ministries and families within the First Born Family. We believe it is now time to go from Glory to Glory. That’s why the theme for this year’s anniversary was divinely chosen as moving from Glory to Glory. The programme which will be presided over by the General Overseer of the RCCG, Pastor E.A. Adeboye along with his wife, Foluke, Oyitso said is not just a conference but the anniversary of the First Born Family in RCCG and would serves as a way of celebrating God’s faithfulness. “God has been gracious to us in the First Born Family. We have been growing in leaps and bounds and several incredible testimonies have been recorded that are too numerous to mention. As a way of celebrating God’s faithfulness, we gather every year to rejoice, thank God and be blessed for the coming year,” he added. The First Born Family, Oyitso revealed, got its name from being the first model parish in the RCCG after Pastor Adeboye took over as the General Overseer of the RCCG. Highlights of this year’s anniversary will include free meal at the venue of the programme while free transportation will be provided at strategic places all around Lagos and its environs to convey people to the venue.
