Cadbury Nigeria Plc. has deepened its interest in the development of football in the country as its Tom Tom brand signed a three-year partnership deal with the Nigerian Football Federation, NFF, to support the Nigerian football league.
As a result of the new deal, Tom Tom was unveiled as the official candy of the Super Eagles, making it a decade since the company first announced the partnership in 2008.
Announcing the union, Managing Director of the firm,  Mr. Amir Shamsi, stated that the deal was not coincidental rather it was a deliberate effort by the partnering teams to connect with Nigerians and their passion for football.
“We promise to continuously support the Super Eagles and also seize this opportunity to enjoin Nigerians to give their full support to the team. We believe in the team, so we implore Nigerians to have confidence in them. They are poised to make us proud,” he said.
Also speaking at the signing ceremony, Category Marketing Lead for West Africa, Mrs. Uwadiae Chidinma, dwelt on the   benefits of Tom Tom as a candy with a purpose.
“It delivers soothing relief and mental invigoration. It has remained relevant over the decades despite other competitive offerings in the market and that is why it   is undisputedly one of the most ubiquitous brands in the country,” she noted.
President of NFF, Mr. Amaju Pinnick, lauded the initiative, saying the federation would work in tandem with the  brand and leverage on the partnership to bring glory to the national team at every tournament.
Also, the Brand Manager, Candy West Africa, Mr Aruleba Olumide urged  Nigerians to encourage the national team by supporting them as he said this was important to motivate them to victory.
