Detectives attached to Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), Lagos State Police Command have arrested a Muslim cleric, alongside two others for the attempted kidnap of one Alhaji Salisu Idris’ daughter. The suspects who were paraded by the Lagos State Commissioner of Police,  Imohimi Edgal, were arrested following a tip off information by the Muslim cleric, Bagudu Bello, who had been invited by the two other suspects, Isah Idris and Abubakar Abdullahi, to take part in the kidnap. According to the CP, Bello was invited from Kaduna to take part in the kidnap because he is an Islamic scholar who can easily access the victim’s house where a mosque is located.
He said: “However, when Bello sighted  Salisu, he discovered that he is someone who he knew from his hometown and had been good to him. “He then sought audience with Salisu’s wife who later discussed the plan with her husband and subsequently reported to the police.
“The operatives of the command asked Bello to lure Isah Idris and Abubakar Abdullahi that the job was done. When they came out of hiding, they were arrested. The third suspect, Abubakar Ibrahim learnt of the arrest and bolted.” Bello said he was contacted by the suspects to come to Lagos for a business which was not disclosed to him.
He said: “On getting to Lagos, we lodged at an hotel at Iyana-Ipaja after which I queried the suspect for bringing me to an hotel. “Later he took me out to show me Salisu’s house and told me that I will come back to kidnap his daughter which I refused.
“He later told me that they had a business worth N250million together which  Salisu had refused to pay him. “When I went back to the mosque in the house to pray, I called the attention of the man and told him how they had planned to kidnap his daughter following which they were arrested.”
The CP said investigation is ongoing and effort is on to arrest the fleeing suspect, adding that the already arrested suspects would have their day in court.
