The Edo State Government has called for 300 volunteers among primary school teachers working in public schools to pilot its Edo Best programme, an initiative designed to introduce and entrench the use of computers, tablets and other Information and Communication Technology-based gadgets for teaching across the state. Special Adviser to Governor Godwin Obaseki on Basic Education and Acting Chairperson, Edo State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Dr. Joan Oviawe, who disclosed this, urged teachers in public primary schools to tap from the opportunity to upgrade their skills and become versed in updated approach for impacting knowledge. She said the programme is expected to lead to better learning outcomes and a more robust, up-to-date approach to classroom management in public schools. Edo Best Programme is an initiative of Governor Obaseki administration, conceived to transform primary education in the state. According to Dr. Oviawe, “In the pilot phase, 300 schools will be selected to launch the initiative and the headmasters/headmistresses and teachers who would head or teach in these schools have to be trained in the use of computers and other gadgets to teach in the classroom. By the next academic year, all headmasters/headmistresses and teachers in the state will be required to go through this training.” She said at the end of the training, teachers and head teachers will each receive a computer tablet loaded with lesson notes. On how the teachers can enroll for the programme, she said, “Teachers are requested to forward their Names, positions (HM or Teacher), salary grade level, academic qualifications, the LGAs where they currently teach and their present school to Edo SUBEB.  Every volunteer must send their information.” She allayed fears that the programme is intended to test teachers, noting that further enquiries on the programme should be routed to SUBEB.
