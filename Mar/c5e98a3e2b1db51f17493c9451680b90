Within the period, the sector maintained steady growth except in 2010 when there was a decline in the oil and gas business growth from N31.577billion in 2009 to a decline of N26.095 billion in2010. There was also a decline in 2014 when premium generated from the class of business declined from N66.813 billion in 2013 to N52.871billion in 2014.It also went further down in 2015 to stand at N51.120 billion, before it rose again in 2016 to hit N54.130 billion. The industry witnessed the highest growth in oil and gas insurance premium generation in 2013 when it grew to N66.813 billion. The least growth was recorded in 2007 when the premium stood at N12.941billion.
The NIA data revealed that the federal governmentâ€™s local content policy and the formation of the energy pool to a reasonable extent enhanced the premium generated by the companies. Before the above policies came on board, oil and gas insurance was the preserve of foreign insurers but with the introduction of oil and gas pool formation, more oil and gas insurance businesses were given to indigenous insurers. Insurance sector operators have expressed optimism that the result of the oil and gas pool formed by the industry will reflect more on the premium generated by indigenous insurers in the years to come.
