In commemoration of World Forest Day 2018, officials of the Cleaner Lagos Initiative organised a comprehensive tour of the engineered sanitary landfill located in Epe, under construction by Visionscape Sanitation. Visionscape Sanitation, residential waste collection concessionaires in Lagos State, had won the tender process in August 2016, and as part of their agreement, commenced construction of the landfill in 2017 amongst other infrastructural projects and reforms in the state. The purpose of the tour, which was well attended by key environmentalists, Environmental Advocacy groups, Waste Management companies, Non-governmental Organisations and representatives from government institutions in the state, such as; KidsBeachGarden, 123Recycle, RecyclePoints, E-Terra, and others, was to give members of the public, an insight into the workings of an engineered sanitary landfill and the process of waste management within a controlled environment. The tour was handled by Mr. Sumeet Singh, the Landfill Operations Manager, who revealed that over 350 scavengers had been registered and inducted into Visionscape’s processes. According to Singh, an average of 30 trucks from various Waste Collection Operators in the state already visit the landfill daily to dispose waste, which was then levelled to prevent waste piling. Sumeet reiterated the company’s commitment to working with all waste collection operators saying “Visionscape is committed to building local capacity in the waste management industry, we will work and support all players to improve standards and overall efficiency of all Waste Management operations”. Visionscape kickstarted operations at the landfill in January 2018, it takes an average of 18-24months to construct an Engineered Sanitary Landfill. The landfill at Epe is the first one in Nigeria and is expected to serve as an Ecopark where waste-to-energy plans, wastewater treatment, material recycling, and other vital environmental friendly procedures are carried out daily
