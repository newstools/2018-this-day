Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, was recently in the news. Quoted as calling for a coup, the military leadership, in a statement by the Director of Defence Information, Brig Gen John Agim, reacted swiftly, frowning at the deputy Senate president’s reported view as an embarrassment that could portray it as disloyal to the president. But Ekweremadu has denied saying any such thing, contending that his comment was taken out of context. He maintained that he only condemned alleged abuse of power by the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, in a generic manner. He said: “We warned that it was this kind of reckless abuse of power and impunity that scuttled our democracy earlier, especially in the first republic and I cautioned that politicians should not take things for granted.” Truth is that Ekweremadu has not said anything out of place, no matter how the opposition or anyone at that tries to slant the meaning or weep up sentiment. The level of executive recklessness in some parts of the country and even sometimes at the federal level is a clear indication that this tottering democracy is being taken for granted.
These are warnings that cannot and must not be ignored, indeed, by all lovers of Nigeria and her democracy.
