Calls for more efforts on Chibok girls Senator representing Anambra South, Andy Uba, has commended the federal government and all the security agencies that played different roles in the release of Dapchi Secondary School girls on Wednesday in Yobe State. Uba, who is the Chairman, Senate Committee on Interior, said the release of over 100 schoolgirls, which was greeted by euphoria, was a testimony of a government that is committed to the safety of its citizens.
As grief trailed the deaths of five of the girls, Uba joined the rest of Nigerians to console the bereaved families who lost their daughters. He said on no account should any innocent soul anywhere in Nigeria be taken for whatsoever agitation.
The senator urged the authorities concerned to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the only girl left in captivity is released unhurt and be reunited with her family. He, however, charged all the security operatives to be more proactive in protecting the lives and property of Nigerians across the country.
He added that speedy economic growth and overall development could only be possible in an environment where there is tranquility. The 110 schoolgirls were abducted on February 19 from Dapchi by Boko Haram insurgents, which was condemned across the globe.
“As I rejoice over the safe return of the over 100 schoolgirls, I am deeply pained over the deaths of the five, even as I’m more concerned about the one still being held in captivity. Our children shouldn’t be learning under the fear of being kidnapped by gunmen,” Uba said. He further urged the federal government and the security agencies to intensify more efforts towards the safe release of the remaining schoolgirl, Leah Sharibu and the Chibok schoolgirls who had been abducted from Borno.
