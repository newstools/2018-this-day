Nigeria is set for its first online trade exhibition to be anchored by  Best Hope Services, BHS, in May.
The initiative, according to the organisers, followed the need  to promote innovations by local inventors, scholars and entrepreneurs.
Speaking on the exercise, Chief Executive Officer of BHS, Olu Adenodi, said the e-fair would   enable investors from different sectors of the economy to showcase their products to the world without having to hire an exhibition ground while visitors can also conveniently participate without leaving the comfort of their homes or offices.
“We observed that most innovations in our tertiary institutions will only be heard of for a while but would not be developed, this medium allows for the promotion of such.
“We are creating an opportunity of translating what is obtainable only on land or terrestrial into the air or outer space, taking full advantage of technology and utilising the internet to the fullest,” he added.
Also speaking, the originator of the e-Fair, Prof. Joseph Mba said that the online expo would have huge positive impact on national development.
According to him, Nigeria and Africa academic researchers, inventors and problem solvers would be inspired and motivated to creativity and innovations with this idea.
He said that the e-fair would cover four strategic areas: e-fair expo, e-fair connect, e-fair trade and e-fair events with the aim to have an online trade fair and urged Nigerians to register on the website ahead of the first  expo targeted at all industries.
“The timetable had been drawn for different sectors like technology, automobiles, electronics – home and office durable consumables. We urge Nigerians to register before the fair commences in May,” he said.
