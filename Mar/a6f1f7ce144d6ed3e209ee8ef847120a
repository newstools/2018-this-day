Jonathan Eze Governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Gombe State, Muhammad Barde has called on voters in the state to go out enmass and register for and collect their Permanent Voters Card (PVC ). In a statement released by his Media Office on Monday, Barde is reported to have reminded them that the PVC is their voting right and power to determine their future and to determine who will govern them in their best interest. He urged those who had just attained the required voting age of 18, to visit the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Office in their respective wards and local governments to go and register for their PVC. The former Bank Chief executive officer added that there are reports that thousands of PVC are in the various INEC offices in the 11 local government areas that are yet to be collected. His words: “The PVC is the power of the people. It is the tool they need to change and renegotiate their future. It is their power to ensure that their next governor would be someone who cares about them and is sensitive to their needs. A governor who would provide them with world class hospitals and health centres, world class education because i believe there cannot be prosperity without good education, youth and women empowerment, good road network, water supply where they won’t have to spend all their savings in buying water, and a governor that would revive Commerce and trade that Gombe people are reputable for among other social services for the people. “Now that my people in Gombe have experienced what the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) can offer and they are not better off, it is time to give the APC a chance to make life better for them both young and old. “Ours would be an administration that revolves around the people with people oriented projects to be executed across all the local government areas but all of these won’t happen if the people do not collect their cards to vote for change.”
