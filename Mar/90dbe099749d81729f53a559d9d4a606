Visionscape Sanitation Solutions said yesterday there was no reason to be afraid after a resolution of the Lagos State House of Assembly to summon some commissioners and other members of the executive arm to explain the state of waste management in the state. Visionscape said while the Assembly was performing its statutory function, the company also had a legitimate waste management contract with the state government that placed duties on both parties.  The House of Assembly had in a resolution invited the Accountant-General of the state, Mrs. Abimbola Umar, and three members of the State Executive Council to brief its ad hoc committee on the waste management situation in Lagos and the role and status of Visionscape. Those invited were the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Adeniji Kazeem; Commissioner for Finance, Mr Akinyemi Ashade; and Commissioner for Environment, Mr Babatunde Durosinmi-Etti. But in an interactive session with journalists on Friday, a representative of Visionscape, Dipo Wintoki, said the Assembly was performing its statutory function and there was no cause for alarm since Visionscape had a valid contract from the state government. Wintoki said, “The emergence of the contract was done through regular and due process. The Lagos State Government has an obligation to fulfil its part of the contract. The process of awarding the contract to Visionscape was not arbitrary. This will be resolved.”
