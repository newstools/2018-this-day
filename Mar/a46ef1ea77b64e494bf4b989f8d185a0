Paris St Germain are hoping their Parc des Princes crowd will help them overturn a 3-1 deficit in their Champions League last-16 return leg against Real Madrid as they try to cope without the injured Neymar. The talismanic Brazilian forward was ruled out of the game tonight after undergoing foot surgery, but PSG coach Unai Emery is confident the home fans will play a key role. “You play a game with your head and your heart. On Tuesday (tonight), the heart will be the most important thing,” Emery told a news conference yesterday. “And we will be playing with 12 players tonight because we will have the backing of the crowd.”
PSG has lost its last five return legs in the Champions League, notably going out in the last 16 last season when it slumped to a 6-1 loss at Barcelona after beating the Spanish side 4-0 in Paris. “Our team, even without Neymar, is able to beat the best Real Madrid team,” said Emery.
“With Neymar, PSG is stronger, but we are still strong without him,” fullback, Dani Alves said. “There are two options: either we sit and cry, or we stand on our feet and fight.”
If the Paris team is going to knock out the defending champions, PSG will need to be more focused than during the first leg, when it conceded two goals in the last 10 minutes. “In the first leg we played better, had the best opportunities. But this time we need to do that for 90 minutes, not just 80,” Alves said. TODAY
