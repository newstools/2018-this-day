The lead lasted only 12 minutes before Ifeanyi Ifeanyi curled in a free-kick to send the home fans into jubilation. Haggai Katoh netted the winner two minutes after the break after Heartlandâ€™s Uche Odeh miskicked a clearance. The visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 63rd minute after Nnamdi Egbujor was sent off for a second bookable offence.
