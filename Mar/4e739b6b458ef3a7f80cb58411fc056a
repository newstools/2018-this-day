 Hon. Osemwegie-Ero, who disclosed this during an interview with journalists in Benin City, said, “On February 26, cultural clubs were inaugurated in secondary schools in Edo South at an event held at the Imaguero College, where over 380 students represented 50 schools from Edo South Senatorial District.” “The children who attended the event learnt a lot. Prominent Palace Chiefs spoke to the children on the essence of learning about cultures. Children from four schools, who wrote essays on the theme of the 2017 Edo Fest: Arts, Culture: “Our Wealth” were rewarded and got to seat at the high table as measures to encourage them,” Ero said. Noting that similar events are being planned for secondary schools in Edo North and Central districts, Osemwegie-Ero said, “Similar event will hold in Edo North at St. John Modern College, Fugar, on April 20, 2018. On the same day, there will be another event in Edo Central at Uromi Town Hall. Traditional rulers, Commissioners for Education and Youths, notable Edo artistes and other stakeholders in the arts and culture sector, will be at these events to encourage the students and add colour to the event.” The commissioner said the Godwin Obaseki led-administration intends to inculcate cultural norms and values in children in secondary schools, noting, “This will be done in such a way that the children will grow up with our cultural norms and values.” He noted, “It is unfortunate that many children can’t communicate in Edo languages and don’t understand cultural values. Children must be assisted to correct the trend.” Osemwegie-Ero explained that the cultural club activities will be introduced in secondary schools, adding, “We also plan to organise cultural competitions for the students where they will be rewarded. We intend to approach the Benin Monarch, Oba Ewuare II, to support the initiative, as he continues to demonstrate passion to promote the learning of cultural values.”
