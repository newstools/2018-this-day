Akwa United were stunned 2-0 away to Katsina United friday in a rescheduled Match-day 11 fixture of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) at the Muhammadu Dikko Stadium in Katsina. The defeat costs the Promise Keepers the chance to leapfrog Lobi Stars to the summit of the Nigerian topflight. The win preserved Katsina United’s unbeaten home run in the NPFL this season. Akwa United remains in the second position despite the defeat, while Katsina United moved from 13th to eighth in the table. The Changi Boys have now won six home games in a row following their opening day 2-2 home draw against Kano Pillars. Martins Usule headed the hosts in front in the eighth minute after he was set up by Sani Faisal. Earlier on Wednesday, Enyimba defeated visiting MFM FC 2-0 at the UJ Esuene Stadium in Calabar. Despite going down to 10 men for over half an hour following the sending off of defender Isiaka Oladuntoye, the seven-time league champions held on to their first-half advantage to the very end. In so doing, the People’s Elephant recorded a first-ever win in this league fixture. There were two changes made to the side which drew last weekend in Damaturu against Yobe Desert Stars. Winger and top scorer Stanley Dimgba returned to the starting line-up, as did defender Nelson Ogbonnaya. It was the latter who would have a decisive impact on proceedings, opening the scoring in the 12th minute. Abdulrahman Bashir had, only minutes earlier, come close to turning in the opener from a corner; this time, he turned provider, lobbing a perfect delivery for Ogbonnaya to attack at the far post and power past MFM’s Ospino Egbe. There followed two close shaves for striker Ibrahim Mustapha, before the visitors dug themselves into further trouble by giving away a penalty. Defender Bashiru Monsuru was adjudged to have handled in the box, giving the referee no choice but to point to the spot. Chinonso Okonkwo stepped up, sending the goalkeeper the wrong way to double the advantage.
