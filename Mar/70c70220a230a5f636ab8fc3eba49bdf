Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has called on Christians to imbibe the virtue of selfless service in commemoration of the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ at Calvary. Obaseki made the call to mark Good Friday, a holiday in the Christian calendar which marks the end of the 40 days Lenten season. It is celebrated by several Christian denominations across the world. He noted, “As Christian faithful celebrate the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on Calvary, I urge everyone to take this opportunity to reflect on the significance of this day, the solemnity of selfless service and the passion for the downtrodden. “As we go about our activities to mark this day, we should not forget to make sacrifices for the development of our nation. This is necessary to set Nigeria on the path of progress.” Obaseki added, “Good Friday brings to the fore, the love of Christ for mankind, for which he gave his life. So also should we remember to be our brother’s keeper, upholding the spirit of togetherness and sacrifice for the greater good of all. “The spirit of sacrifice as exemplified by Jesus Christ who offered himself for mankind on the cross of Calvary should be a lesson for all Christians. Genuine love for humanity can only be expressed when we take the teachings and examples of Christ to heart.” Obaseki urged Christians to use the occasion of Good Friday to pray for peace and progress of the country, noting, “It is only when there is peace that meaningful progress can be achieved. We must all work towards ensuring peace in our neighbourhoods, state and country.”
