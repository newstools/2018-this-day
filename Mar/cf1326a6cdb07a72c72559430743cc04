Like an ancient mariner whose heartbeat dwarfs echoes of his incredible exploits, Prince Adedapo Abiodun, commands the awe of many of his peers and admirers in Nigeria’s socio-political and business sector. There is no gainsaying the world of business is like a dangerous coast riddled with storms. But despite its turbulent tides, the Chairman of Heyden Group, like a sea-hardened sailor navigates through the gales armed with a strong resolve and unyielding spirit. Today, that relentless spirit of Dapo has paid off. It has guided him through the bittersweet, cut-throat world of global commerce till he emerged unscathed and undaunted in spirit and resolve, like a champion. DA, as he is fondly called, offers revealing and undeniably delightful anecdotes of the influences that impacted on the child that he was and the man that he has become. Last Thursday, Dapo and some other newly appointed chairpersons and board members of parastatals were inaugurated in Abuja. Dapo is the Chairman of Corporate Affairs Commission. They are the new champions of modernity. From banking, transportation, entertainment, to the oil and energy sector, these young Turks of commerce, run a tight and firmly wheeled ship. Contrary to apprehensions about the emergence of such daring, economic forces as they represent, they do not come with baggage of old or new scandal, neither are they harbingers of renewed hand-wringing and grime that characterise decay in business ethics, they come with solutions – dependable solutions to be precise – fairer terms, tighter regulation, progressive business and industry blueprints, punishments for wrongdoing, perhaps even a Hippocratic Oath for entrepreneurial hopefuls. These league of extraordinary magnates are hardworking, highly educated, jet-setting meritocrats with the can-do attitude and spunk of deserving winners of a tough, worldwide economic competition.
