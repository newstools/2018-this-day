Duro Ikhazuagbe After weeks of speculations on players to make Gernot Rohr’s squad for the World Cup 2018 build up matches against Poland and Serbia, Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), yesterday unveiled a 28-man list with Skipper John Mikel Obi as arrowhead. Apart from usual suspects like Victor Moses, Ogenyi Onazi, Williams- Troost Ekong, Leon Balogun, Wilfred Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho, Ahmed Musa, Odion Ighalo, Alex Iwobi and Elderson Echiejile, the Super Eagles coach also recalled former junior international defender, Kenneth Omeruo and injury prone Joel Obi to strengthen the midfield. Also, home-based goalkeeper, Ikechukwu Ezenwa, who stood between the sticks for the very crucial last four World Cup qualifying games (home-and-away to Cameroon, home to Zambia and away to Algeria), his colleagues in the 2018 African Nations Championship (CHAN) squad that finished as runners up to host Morocco, defender Stephen Eze and forward Gabriel Okechukwu, are also handed opportunities. The Franco-German gaffer also extended invites to Deportivo La Coruna’s Francis Uzoho and Daniel Akpeyi of Chippa United in the South African topflight. Russia-based Brian Idowu, who scored against Argentina on his debut in a friendly in Krasnodar in November last year, and Al Ahly of Egypt’s Junior Ajayi, who earned an Olympic bronze in Brazil in 2016, are also called. Three-time African champions Nigeria will trade tackles with the Bialo-Czerwoni (White and Red) or Eagles, as the senior national team of Poland is known, at the 43,000-capacity Stadium Wroclaw on Friday, 23rd March 2018.
