The Nigerian-American Chamber of Commerce in collaboration with Fosad Consulting, LLC. has recently organised a workshop on ‘Strategic Innovation for Entrepreneurs’ as part of its effort to foster the growth and development of entrepreneurship in the country. The one day packed workshop held at the Chamber’s Secretariat in February witnessed the attendance of entrepreneurs and Business owners across sectors gathered to learn innovative ways to get ahead of their competition in an evolving global economy. To meet consumers’ needs in a world-class business environment, Entrepreneurs require the knowledge and skills needed to manage the development of innovations, to recognise and evaluate potential opportunities to monetise these innovations, to plan specific and detailed methods to exploit these opportunities, and to acquire the resources necessary to implement these plans. The importance of innovation in entrepreneurship is a key value for the longevity of a business as operational performance alone is not enough to create sustained competitive differentiation in a global marketplace. The workshop which was facilitated using real life case studies, discussions and presentations for knowledge sharing focused on identifying opportunities, managing risk, organising resources and value addition. Participants were also lectured on developing a business model for a new venture and attitudes, values, characteristics, behavior and processes associated with possessing an entrepreneurial mindset. The Chamber is passionate about the growth of MSME and SME businesses in Nigeria and will continue to present platforms wherein they are nurtured on a global scale thus linking Nigerian Businesses to Global Enterprise.
