Telecommunications giant, Globacom, has admonished Nigerians to supplicate to God for the peace and unity of the nation on the occasion of the 2018 Easter celebrations. “Easter period is the culmination of Lent and a vivid reminder to Christian faithful to deepen acts of sacrifice, peace and love for one another as well as the nation during the season and beyond. Let us all continue to pray for peace and economic prosperity that will thwart the efforts of all centrifugal forces in the country”, the company said in a press statement issued from its Lagos head office recently. Globacom disclosed that Easter, a celebration marking the watershed crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ is a veritable demonstration of divine selfless love which should be emulated by all and sundry to make Nigeria, nay, the world a better place to live in. While calling on Christians to externalise the virtues of Easter in all their undertakings by dwelling in love, unity and good neighbourliness that will propel Nigeria to the heights of her dreams, the network assured its esteemed subscribers of quality experiences on voice and data services throughout the holiday period and beyond
