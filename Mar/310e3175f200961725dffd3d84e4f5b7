Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said his administration will continue to build on the sterling legacies of former governor of the defunct Mid-West and Bendel States, late Dr. Samuel Osaigbovo Ogbemudia. Obaseki made the submission at the weekend during a visit to the family of late Ogbemudia, as part of the activities to mark the one-year anniversary of the former governor’s death. Late Samuel Ogbemudia was born on September 17, 1932. He served as an officer in the Nigerian Army and was the military administrator of the defunct Mid-West State between 1967 and 1975. Ogbemudia also served as a civilian governor in the old Bendel State in 1983. His tenure was cut short by the December 1983 military coup. He died on March 9, 2017, aged 84 years. According to Obaseki, who was represented by his Chief of Staff, Chief Taiwo Akerele, “We would not forget in a hurry, the fond memories of the late ex-governor, whose outstanding achievements and contributions in all sectors of the state’s economy are still standing today.” The governor assured the late Ogbemudia’s family of the state government’s continued support. He said, “The emergence of Eghe Ogbemudia as chairman, Egor Local Government Area shows that the people appreciate and trust the late governor’s family in delivering dividends of democracy.” Chairman Egor Local Government council and daughter of the late governor, Eghe Ogbemudia, expressed appreciation to Edo and Delta states for their continued support, noting, “The Ogbemudia family appreciates the goodwill of Edo and Delta people.” On his part, first son of the late Elder statesman, Samuel Ogbemudia Jr. said, “The family will continue to celebrate the legacies of our father. I appreciate Edo and Delta states, which formed the old Bendel State for their commitment to keeping the legacies of our father.”
