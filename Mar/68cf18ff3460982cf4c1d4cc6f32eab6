England striker Harry Kane had to be substituted half an hour into Tottenham’s game at Bournemouth yesterday after injuring his right ankle. Kane, 24, was injured in a collision with home keeper Asmir Begovic, poking the ball into the net for a goal that was ruled out for offside. He immediately left the field and went straight down the tunnel. Spurs meet Swansea on Saturday in the FA Cup, with England playing two friendly matches in the following week. Gareth Southgate’s men travel to the Netherlands on Friday, 23 March before hosting Italy on 27 March with the squad being named on Thursday. Last season, Kane missed 10 games for his club after suffering ligament damage to the same right ankle in Spurs’ Premier League win at Sunderland in September. He also missed two of England’s World Cup qualifiers – a 2-0 win over against Malta in Gareth Southgate’s first game in interim charge and a goalless draw against Slovenia. Kane injured the same ankle on 12 March 2017, almost a year ago to the day he was hurt at Bournemouth, in Tottenham’s FA Cup victory over Millwall. On that occasion he missed four weeks of action, including England’s 1-0 friendly defeat against Germany and a 2-0 win over Lithuania in a World Cup qualifier.
