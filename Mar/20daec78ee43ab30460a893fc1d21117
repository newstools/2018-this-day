Argentina Star, Lionel Messi, is aware time is fast running out on his international career and the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia may be his last chance to win a senior international title. In an incredible career in which he’s won virtually every title including five Ballon d’Or gongs, a senior title with the Albiceleste is the only chink in his shining armour. Argentina has been three-time Copa America runners-up and also lost the 2014 World Cup final in Brazil in Messi’s 12 years with the senior team. The 30-year-old is now desperate to go one better in Russia, with his team having been beaten by Germany in extra time in Rio de Janeiro four years ago. “We feel that, if we won’t win the World Cup in Russia, the only way will be to give up the national team,” Messi told La Cornisa on Sunday. “I dream of winning the trophy in Russia. My wish is to live something similar to Brazil 2014. “You can do everything OK and fail, like Argentina in Brazil.” Argentina is considered favourites in a World Cup preliminary group which has Iceland, Croatia and Nigeria in Group D. Meanwhile, Argentina striker, Gonzalo Higuain, reckons the upcoming international friendlies against Spain and Italy will reveal La Albiceleste’s true potentials ahead of the World Cup which kicks off in Russia in June. Argentina , two-time world champions, will face the Azzurri of Italy at the Etihad Stadium in England on March 23rd before battling Spain four days later at the Wanda Metropolitan in Spain. Higuain, recalled to the Argentina squad after missing their last seven games told Mundo Albiceleste that he’s delighted to be back in the fold and looking forward to the challenge. “I’m happy about it. Two important matches, one of them against Spain, which will be a good opportunity to show the potential of Argentina facing the World Cup,” Higuain told Mundo Albiceleste. “I enjoy the national team and there are still important challenges.”
