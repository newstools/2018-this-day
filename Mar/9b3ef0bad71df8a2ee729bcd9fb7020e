Kuni Tyessi inAbuja The Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) has generated more than N38 billion between January and December 2017 from passport revenue, address verification fee, non-refundable administration fee and e-pass, among others. Part of the revenue generated has however, been paid into the government purse, service providers and other stakeholders. This was revealed wednesday in Abuja by the NIS Comptroller General, Muhammed Babandede, who said his agency also generated about $28,850,654 from passports and $1, 087,950 from carrier liability/visa on arrival from foreign collection. Babandede who spoke during an operational review meeting with zonal coordinators and comptrollers of commands, added that his leadership has opened what he called Service Windows at all state commands, zonal and service headquarters for receiving all applications for various immigration services, which he said was “intended to eliminate unnecessary human interface in service delivery and prevention of rent seeking opportunity for extortion, bribery and corruption by officers and non-officers.” While urging the senior officers to ensure discipline at various levels, Babandede said there was need for strict adherence to the provisions of the public service rules and discipline with respect to wearing the correct badges of rank, “especially by officers of Inspectorate Cadre, compliance to the Service Dress Code, appropriate hair, jewelry and make-up by female officers and courteous and friendly behaviour towards customers.” The NIS boss also tasked the senior officers to embrace President Muhammadu Buhari’s initiative on the Ease of Doing Business and the opportunity in the agricultural sector for sustainable alternative as they approach retirement. Babandede further revealed that NIS was commended for being proactive and received a trophy from the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) in recognition of its contributions to the Ease of Doing Business reform in Nigeria.
