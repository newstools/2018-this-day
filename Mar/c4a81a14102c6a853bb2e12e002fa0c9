Also yesterday, the House passed a motion urging the federal government to make adequate budgetary allocation to the National Agency for the Great Green Wall in order to enable it achieve its objectives and asked the Federal Ministries of Environment and Water Resources to fast track the implementation of policies, projects and programmes in line with the Great Green Wall Initiative. It further mandated the Committee on Environment and Habitat to investigate the non-implementation of the Great Green Wall Initiative in Nigerian and report back in eight weeks for further legislative action.
The resolution followed a motion sponsored by Hon. Beni Lar on the need to implement the Great Green Wall Initiative Programme in Nigeria. She said desertification is one of the major environmental challenges threatening the livelihood of millions of Nigerians as it is adversely affecting agricultural practices, especially in the area of livestock production and the worst affected states are Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, Sokoto and Yobe; She noted that as a result of desertification, herdsmen from the affected areas are forced to migrate to other parts of the country in search of pasture resulting in incessant clashes between herdsmen and farmers. The lawmaker recalled that the Great Green Wall Initiative was launched in 2007 by the African Union (AU) with the aim of tackling detrimental social, economic and environmental impacts of land degradation and desertification in the Sahel and Sahara, boost food security and support local Communities to adapt to climate change. She however, expressed concern that the initiative exists only in name, as, instead of reclamation of desert, it is rather expanding and gaining more territories, adding that if nothing is done to forestall further desert encroachment by implementing the Great Green Wall Initiative, clashes between herdsmen and farmers will be on the increase. Meanwhile, the House wednesday adjourned sitting till April 10 to enable members mark the Easter holidays.
