Femi Solaja with agency report Home-based Eagles defender to the last African Nations Championship (CHAN) in Morocco last month, Stephen Eze, has earned an invite to the heart of the defence of the senior national team ahead of the international friendlies. Aside Eze, Al-Ahly forward Junior Ajayi is also in the plan of Franco-German tactician, Gernot Rohr, for the build up matches and their performances could also earn the duo the chance to be at the World Cup in Russia this summer. According to Owngoalnigeria.com, the newly signed on Lokomotiv Plovdiv of Bulgaria defender, Eze, confirmed his invitation via the letter sent to his new club by the national team coach late last month. The defender who was outstanding for Nigeria at the CHAN in Morocco where Eagles finished as runners-up, won the coach over owing to his display at the tournament despite Nigeria losing to host Morocco 4-0 in the final. His Bulgarian club confirmed the invitation of the over six feet tall defender on their website and it was the first time the player will get a chance to be with the established senior players in the national team. While the Al-Ahly forward, Junior Ajayi posted his appreciation to coach Rohr over his call up on his twitter handle. The former junior international expressed his willingness to fight for a spot in the team. “With grateful heart and total respect to the family of @NGSuperEagles and all #Nigerians, this invitation to our National Team is a dream come true. I will make you all proud by the grace of God,” he twitted on his official handle yesterday. In the build up to the World Cup, Super Eagles will play against Poland in Wroclaw on Friday, 23rd March while the game with Serbia is for The Hive in London on Tuesday, 27th March 2018. The team will rap up its build up with the high-profile friendly against England at the Wembley Stadium in London few days to the kick off of the tournament in Russia.
