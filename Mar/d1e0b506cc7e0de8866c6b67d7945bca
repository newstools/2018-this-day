When she was elected in 2007 to represent Adamawa South, the largest senatorial district in the state,  Senator Grace Folasade Bent  made history to the admiration of all.
Her victory in the 2007 election made her the first female senator in the North-East and also the first female senator in the apex lawmaking body based on marital affiliation in the whole of Northern Nigeria (her husband, Jackson Bent,  is an indigene of Adamawa State). However, after spending a term at the upper chamber, conspiracy set in, as the author of  “Inter-ethnic Marriages in Nigeria: Beacon of National Unity” was not allowed to fly the  Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ticket in 2011.
Interestingly,  her fans are now  reportedly yearning for her return to politics, where she has impacted positively on their lives.
The foregoing may not be news to those who are familiar with her adventure in politics.
But information  reaching Spy Glass revealed that the profile of the Ilesha, Osun State-born politician  has begun to soar higher since she made her intention known to seek elective post again in 2019. We gathered that her constituents who have missed her good representation made appeals to her and emissaries were sent out.
A source said, “It has dawned on her constituents that they need her. She is a good politician with human face and a good grassroots person. Since she has agreed to represent them, her residence has turned into a Mecca of sorts.” Before her election into the Senate, Bent was a political adviser to the then PDP National Chairman, Audu Ogbe.”
Apart from being a strong advocate of inter-tribal marriage, the elegant lady, who is the author of Women in Inter-Ethnic Marriages in Nigeria, is at the forefront of women’s participation in governance.
