Obiano told journalists at the Governor’s Lodge, Amawbia, after the meeting that he had fruitful deliberations with the Naval chief, saying that their discussions centred mainly on sustaining the various areas of partnership between the State and the Nigerian Navy. Some of the partnership areas he identified include improving security especially along the waterways, construction works around the state and boosting water transportation. The Governor noted that under the state’s vision to commence water transportation on a larger scale this year, his administration targets to develop 13 creeks across the riverine communities of the state, to make for easy movement of vessels and goods, adding that the Nigerian Navy has a major role in ensuring that government’s intentions are achieved. Usman in his remark explained that his visit was meant to familiarise himself with government and its workings.
