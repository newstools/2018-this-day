Wole Ayodele in Jalingo Four people have been killed in a fresh communal clash which erupted on the Mambilla Plateau yesterday evening between the Fulani and Mambilla ethnic stock. Besides, several houses and other valuables were reportedly set ablaze by the warring factions as both sides were said to have recorded casualties. Though the cause of the current crisis which started at Nguroje before spreading to Jakarta villages is still sketchy, THISDAY gathered that the crisis was ignited by a dispute over land.
Efforts to get an official position from the state police command proved abortive as the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), David Misal, did not respond to his calls. The acting Chairman of the local government area, Rev. Goodwill Sol, could also not be reached on phone.
The crisis is coming despite the operation Ayema Akpatuma launched by the Nigerian Army to curtail the series of violent clashes in some states including Taraba. As at the time of filling the report, the clashes was still raging though THISDAY gathered that security personnel have been drafted to the area to bring the situation under control. Last year June, there was an outbreak of violent clashes in the area which claimed 18 lives and property according to police reports while thousands of people were rendered homeless.
