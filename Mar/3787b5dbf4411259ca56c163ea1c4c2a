Governor of Edo State, Mr Godwin Obaseki has assured that infrastructure development will get to all local government councils in the state, even as he promised the people of Akoko Edo Local Government Area of accelerated completion of the ongoing construction of a 3.5km-long road project in Ugboshi Afe community. The road, it was learnt, was tarred by the late Premier of the then Western Nigeria, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, over 60 years ago, but has since been abandoned. Chief of Staff to the Governor, Chief Taiwo Akerele, who represented the governor during the site tour, at the weekend, said that the project is being delivered in a fashion that belies the ‘wake and see’ approach to governance championed by Governor Obaseki According to him, “I appeal to communities in the state to remain calm as Mr Governor is gradually fulfilling all his promises from one local council to another. “It is regrettable that the people of Ugboshi Afe have had to wait for so long for this road to be constructed. But we assure them that not only will this road be constructed, but it will be delivered in good time.” “The 3.5km-long abandoned road is being constructed by EDSG public works programme at an accelerated pace and will be completed before the end of May 2018,” he added. The people of the community said they are delighted that the governor has extended the infrastructural imprints to them, noting that the state is better off with the dogged approach to delivering on the dividends of democracy. A member of the community, who doesn’t want his name in print, said that the project took members of the community by surprised, thanking governor Obaseki for the good gesture. He said, “We celebrate the arrival of the Obaseki ‘wake and see’ miracle train to our community, 60 years after Chief Obafemi Awolowo tarred this road.”
