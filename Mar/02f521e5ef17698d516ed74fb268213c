The federal government has announced the release of 76 out of the 110 abducted students of Government Girls Science Technical College, Dapchi, Yobe State. A statement by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said the girls were released in the early hours of Wednesday through ‘back-channel’ efforts.
Mohammed said:‎ “The directive by President Muhammadu Buhari to all security agencies to do everything possible to secure the release of the Dapchi schoolgirls, who were abducted 19 Feb. 2018, has yielded fruits, with the confirmed release of 76 of the 110 abducted students in the early hours of Wednesday.‎”
Mohammed said the 76 were those who have been documented so far, adding that the release of the abducted students was ongoing. He said the girls were released around 3 a.m. through back-channel efforts and with the help of some friends of the country, and that it was unconditional. ”For the release to work, the government had a clear understanding that violence and confrontation would not be the way out as it could endanger the lives of the girls, hence a non-violent approach was the preferred option. ”Within the period when the girls were being brought back, operational pause was observed in certain areas to ensure free passage and also that lives were not lost,” Mohammed said. He said the number of the freed girls would be updated after the remaining ones have been documented, especially because the girls were not handed over to anyone but dropped off in Dapchi.
