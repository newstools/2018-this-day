The police and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps in Niger State have braced up to provide security for lives and property during the Easter celebration. While the police said it had put its men on alert in the 25 local government areas of the state, the NSCDC on its part said it had mobilised 1,500 men for the period. Police Public Relations Officer, Muhammad Abubakar in a statement made available to newsmen in Minna wednesday said that “all the black spots in the state will be monitored by plain clothe and uniformed security men. “The Niger State police command has mapped out strategies and put in place measures to provide adequate security in the state particularly at churches and recreational centres to ensure hitch-free celebration.” Abubakar charged the people of the state “to exhibit high level of security consciousness by reporting any suspicious person or group of persons to the police and other security agencies for necessary action.” The state commandant of the NSCDC, Mr. Philip Ayuba, who announced the deployment, said his men would be sent to all strategic places in the state and its environs including motor parks, eateries, churches and recreational centres.” Ayuba also directed all the Area Commanders in the state “to fully take charge of their jurisdictions,” adding that unit heads should also be in charge of officers and men deployed across the state.
Ayuba said the deployment commenced March 29 to be stood down by the state commandant on April 3, 2018 depending on the threat analysis. The commandant warned all miscreants to “stay clear of the state and its environs because all the divisions have been fully fortified with personnel.”
