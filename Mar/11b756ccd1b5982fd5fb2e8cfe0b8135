The Amnesty International has condemned the recent attack on humanitarian workers in Rann, Borno State, and the abduction of 110 girls in Dapchi, Yobe State, by Boko Haram insurgents, saying the Islamic seet must end vicious attacks and its disregard for human life. Responding to Boko Haram’s latest attacks on aid workers in Rann on March 1 and the abduction of 110 school girls in Dapchi, a week earlier, Director, Amnesty International Nigeria, Osai Ojigho, condemned the attack and abduction. “Amnesty International strongly condemns Boko Haram’s attack on humanitarian workers in Rann, Borno State, and the abduction of 110 school girls in Dapchi, Yobe State. The armed group must immediately stop targeting schools and aid workers working in one of the most difficult humanitarian situations in the world. These attacks clearly show that Boko Haram is unrelenting in its unlawful killings and abductions. These attacks on humanitarian workers and abduction of school girls are war crimes, and those responsible must be brought to justice. Attacks on schools also violate the right to education and must be halted. These incidents are chilling reminders of Boko Haram’s depravity. The group must immediately and unconditionally release the girls and all others they have abducted and stop all attacks on civilians. “Suspension of humanitarian assistance as a result of this attack will only worsen the condition of the 55,000 displaced people living in Rann. The government is responsible for the security of those living in displacement camps and must urgently ensure that civilians are protected from all attacks,” Ojigho added.
