Delta listed like a cruise ship penultimate Saturday, when the elder brother of the former governor of Delta State, Chief James Ibori, William Ibori, married his younger lover in Ogharefe, Ethiope West Local Government Area of Delta state. Yes, no longer for William are the lonely cold nights and lonelier days. In fact, now, you can have a horse ride inside his bowels without galloping. The new bride, Princess Ibori, like the fabled enchanteur from the renaissance era, has got William forever pacing the Hadrian’s wall of her shoulder and dreaming of her maiden castle. In the same breadth, she has got him perpetually hooked on her cocktail of love. Since his eyes held with hers and they experienced their first touch, she sent shockwaves of love through his veins like radiant energy. Thus the elderly man became a string to be played by the nimble fingers of his new beloved wife. Meanwhile, in 2010, HRM Oreki II, the Ovie of Oghara Kingdom, derobed the former Unugbrogodo of Oghara Kingdom, William Ibori, as an Okakuro (Chief) of Oghara Kingdom. According to reports, he was derobed as a result of ‘gross acts of disloyalty and disrespect’ to monarch and the traditional institution. He was said to have unlawfully installed 48 persons as chiefs in Ogharefe. On two occasions, he was summoned by the traditional rulers of the 23 Kingdoms in Urhoboland to defend himself , but allegedly chose to snub the royal fathers.
