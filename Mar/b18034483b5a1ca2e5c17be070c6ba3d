Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has tasked parents and other stakeholders to ensure that children below the age of one are immunised to safeguard them against diseases. Governor Obaseki said this in a broadcast monitored on local television stations in Benin City, Edo State capital, on Wednesday. According to the governor, “Routine immunisation is the regular immunisation given at the health centres to children who are below one year of age. The vaccines are to protect children against all vaccine-preventable diseases. The vaccines are safe and potent. The children who are vaccinated will not fall sick often, thus we will be saving on the cost of treating illnesses.” Dismissing fears that the vaccines are harmful to children, Obaseki noted, “The negative news that vaccination is targeted at reducing the population of our people is not correct. Rather, when children are vaccinated, it helps them to live healthier lives and increases life expectancy. It therefore actually enhances population growth. “Children are the future leaders of our great country, therefore every parent and care giver must play their roles and ensure that children do not suffer from preventable diseases. It is also the right of every child to beimmunised.” He urged parents and other stakeholders to ensure that children are immunised, adding, “Immunisation is free and with only five visits to the health centre, the child will be fully protected. Do not be deceived by anyone,immunisation remains the surest way to prevent most childhood killer diseases. “As Governor, I have the responsibility to protect the lives of the people of Edo State, so I am appealing to you to immunise your children. Immunisation is good and safe. Allow your children to be immunised. Parents and caregivers, please take your children who are under one year of age to the nearest health centre,” he advised.
