Executive Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El Rufai, has said that the game of golf has helped grow over $500 million investment in the state. While teeing off the 1st Kadinvest Pro-Am International Golf Tournament at the Kaduna Golf Club wednesday morning, El Rufai, equally an ardent golfer, did not hide his joyful feelings that such huge number of golfers (close to 600) from across Nigeria and some seven West African countries could besiege Kaduna for a golf tourney. He said he would ensure total safety of the golfers and that the event would grow larger during every month of April. “When we said we were going to make Kaduna great again, we were looking at the number of investors we could bring to our state. We introduced the Kadinvest Golf Tournament to attract investors. This is paying off and I personally thank our sponsor, Sir Lucky Omoluwa of Pinnacle Communications, a man I usually refer to as our son, even though he is from Delta State,” observed the Kaduna State governor at the ceremony yesterday. Before performing the ceremonial teeing off, El Rufai entered into a closed session with the management of Kaduna Golf Club headed by its Captain, Col. Ibrahim Biu, where he promised he would help them achieve great dreams. The club’s Board of Trustees Chairman and indeed the Emir of Birnin Gwari, Mallam Maigwari, was equally in the closed session. Thereafter, the governor inspected the total refurbishment of the club mainly financed by Omoluwa’s Pinnacle Communications.
