Following its recent selection as the air transport provider for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation/Chevron Nigeria Limited Joint Venture, Caverton Helicopters Limited has unveiled a fleet of brand new helicopters designed to service the NNPC/CNL JV outfit based in Escravos. Caverton (CHL) was last year awarded a five-year logistics support contract by CNL, operator of the NNPC/CNL JV, for the provision of aviation services with a two-year renewable option. The firm is being supported by US aviation giant, Bell Helicopters; the new fleet comprises of the Bell 407 GXP with executive interior design options, fitted with Rolls-Royce engines and the industry workhorse Bell 412 EP, for optimal performance in adverse conditions. At a recent business luncheon hosted at its Executive Flight facility at the Murtala Muhammad International Airport, Lagos, Managing Director, Sales, Middle East and Africa, Bell Helicopters, David Sale, remarked on being very proud to partner Caverton, having been in Nigeria since 1964. CHL Chairman, Adeniyi Makanjuola remarked on the achievements being the result of an extended skills transfer to an indigenous work force over an 8-year period, in line with the national content policy. According to him, Caverton was fasttracking the national content policy by ensuring that more Nigerians were trained and given priority in recruitment for high technician management positions. The Director, NNPC/CNL JV, Mr. Monday Ovuede, said Caverton’s unveiling of 11 helicopters marked an expansion of the company’s capacity to dominate the Nigerian airspace – a manifestation of its resilience to ensure that aviation industry became enviable. “Our plan is to pick and deliver over 800 passengers every day; we will ensure zero accident as we increase our efforts to protect our people. With over 50 years of doing business, I assure you that we will be here in the next 50 years,” he said.
