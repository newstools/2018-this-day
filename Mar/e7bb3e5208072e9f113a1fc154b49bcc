The director general made the accusation in a message he sent to the 2018 Corps Employers Workshop held at the Education Resource Centre in Minna, Niger State on Wednesday. “Efforts aimed at curbing absenteeism and abscondment are being frustrated by some corps employers,” Kazaure said, stressing that “this will no longer be tolerated by the scheme”. “We have increased the number of regular inspection of corps members at their places of primary assignment while ensuring that absentee corps members are sanctioned,” Kazaure, who was represented by the Assistant Corps Welfare Officer of the scheme, Mrs Ngozi Ugo, said.
