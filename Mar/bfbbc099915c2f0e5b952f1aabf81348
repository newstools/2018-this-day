By Jonathan Eze A former Minister of State for Defence, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, has confirmed that he is still in the race to represent Lagos West senatorial district in the National Assembly. The camp of the incumbent Senator, Olamilekan Adeola, has been jittery since the news resonated that the former minister is making plans to return to the Senate after his first impressive outing between 2003 and 2007. The All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain and a grassroots mobiliser, through his Media Office in Lagos, rebutted the claim that he had stepped down on Sunday. Obanikoro insisted that he is interested in serving his people with his ‘winning together’ slogan, and has lined up several programmes aimed at empowering the Lagos West people who are so fond of him. The media office added that it is a common knowledge that the incumbent senator is returning to his state (Ogun) to contest the governorship election in 2019 and has held several rallies and strategic meetings in the state to garner support for his ambition. In an event held recently to endorse Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, for second term by the people of Lagos West senatorial district, it was reported that some supporters of Adeola took advantage of the occasion and advised Adeola to return to Ogun State where he belongs and would be accepted, which is an indication that Obanikoro enjoys warmth and stronger support from the people of the district.
