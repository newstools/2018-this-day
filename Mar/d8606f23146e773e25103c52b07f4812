The different range of sounds, rhythms and beats deployed by contemporary African musicians to delight mankind and create popular melodies are the talking points of this week’s edition of CNN African Voices sponsored by Globacom. Johannesburg based eclectic band, Bombshelter Beast, with the mission to produce “music to make feet dance and heart happy” is the first guest on the programme. The group established in 2015 consists of colourful, brilliant and innovative artistes who perform a mixed-grill of musical styles dubbed “Afrobalkan Skadubhall”. A statement from the Mobile service provider said the programme then pans to Khartoum to capture the brilliance of Islam Elbeiti, Sudan’s first female bassist breaking barriers in the music industry with an instrument traditionally played by men. Viewers will find her mantra “inhale poetry and exhale the pain. Feel the bass and let it rain” intriguing on the programme. British-Nigerian singer and songwriter, Ola Onabule, is the last guest on the programme this week. The highly prolific artiste with a career spanning two decades has over eight albums to his credit. He released his first album “More Soul Than Sense” in 1995 and has featured at major international fora like the British Summer Jazz series and the Umbria Jazz Festival in Italy amongst many others.
