Kasim Sumaina in Abuja The Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, Monday in Abuja inaugurated the new boards of agencies and parastatals in the ministry. Inaugurating the boards on behalf of the federal government, the minister noted that the event signalled another milestone in the ministry’s effort to consolidate on the gains of the Muhammadu Buhari-led government’s reforms in the Nigerian mining industry as evidenced by the data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) which indicate a strong sectoral contribution to the economic renaissance in recent times. According to him, “On behalf of my brother ministerial colleague, Hon. Abubakar Bawa-Bwari, Minister of State; and Dr. Abdulkadir Mu’azu, Permanent Secretary, I warmly welcome you to this occasion, being the formal inauguration of the newly constituted boards of agencies and parastatals under the Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel Development.” Speaking further, he said: “This development is timely and is in line with continuous efforts aimed at further strengthening the capacity of our ministry and her entities to fulfil our collective mandates of increasing the mining sector’s contribution to our sovereign revenue, and significantly creating jobs and broadening the range of economic opportunities available to young Nigerians. “This is a government that is committed to transparency and accountability in corporate governance. I must therefore emphasise that the role of the governing boards is to provide effective oversight and strategic advisory to the respective management teams of these entities. “I therefore call on all concerned to study and strictly adhere to the laid down laws that have clearly defined the roles and responsibilities of the board members.” Details later…
