By Laleye Dipo in Minna Former military president General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida and one time Chief of Army Staff General Theophilus Yakubu Danjuma met behind closed doors  in Minna the Niger state capital on Thursday evening. The meeting which was held at the uphill residence of General Babangida reportedly lasted close to three hours. A source close to the residence told THISDAY that General Danjuma was flown into Minna via a private jet which landed at the Minna airport. From the airport one of the vehicles of General Babangida drove General Danjuma to the hilltop. “After the normal exchange of pleasantries, they went in to have lunch ” the source said before adding that all the domestic staff of the former military president were then asked to excuse the duo who immediately went into the meeting. “Nobody can tell you what they discussed at the meeting, it was IBB and TY Danjuma” the source said. After the meeting, the former Chief of Army staff was driven to the Minna airport from where he was flown out of the state. The visit of General Danjuma came almost a month after General Babangida wrote an open   letter to President Muhammadu Buhari on the state of the nation. It also came 11 days after insurgents abducted 110 school girls at Dapchi in Bauchi state. It  was believed that the meeting between the duo would have centred on the two issues and the prevailing situation in the country.–
