The Federal Government has revealed plans to partner with Edo state to boost youth empowerment in the South-South and South-East geo-political zones, as not less than 121 youths graduated from a capacity building workshop organised for youths in the zones. Minister of Youths and Sports, Barr. Solomon Dalung, who addressed the beneficiaries trained under the National Youth Empowerment Programme (NYEP) at Okada, Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo state, said the programme is intended to encourage entrepreneurship. The youths were trained on cosmetology, bead making, aquaculture, piggery, cassava processing and value addition, as well as interior decoration and event management. According to Dalung, “The objective of the NYEP is to encourage entrepreneurship among youths as well as provide avenue for youths from diverse socio-cultural backgrounds to bond and collaborate in proffering solutions to issues affecting the country.” He added that the NYEP was initiated by the Ministry of Youths and Sports in 2015 to serve as capacity building programme for youths on agro-allied, vocational skills and entrepreneurial skills. “The empowerment programme is designed to solve the problem of unemployment among youths as it intends to expose youths to skills and knowledge that will make them entrepreneurs. An empowered youth with a sustainable means of livelihood will not only create jobs but also contribute to peace and security in the country.” Edo State Commissioner for Youths and Special Duties, Hon. Mike Amanokha, commended the Federal Government for the empowerment programme, noting “The state looks forward to collaborating with the Federal Government to empower more youths in the state.” Amanokha charged the beneficiaries to make good use of the skills acquired as they have displayed commitment during the course of the programme. “I believe you will put to good use the knowledge and skills acquired,” he added.
