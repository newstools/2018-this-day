The MTN subscribers – Aniekpeno Mkpanang, Ademola Sulaiman, Asemota Ivie, Coker Olabisi, Orimoloye Olateju, Arthur Chuks and Kingsley Chinedu arrived in London last week on an Air France flight.
Following the brand’s recent Season of Surprises campaign, a spokesperson for the brand says the trip is ‘a reward for the Arsenal fans and we’re happy they were excited about the surprises in London.’ One of the fans, Olateju, who is a risk management specialist at the Central Bank of Nigeria, says the trip was ‘a much-needed holiday’.
“I’ve always been a big fan of MTN as I am of Arsenal so this was a big deal for me. Plus, it was a chance to get in a little holiday time. What’s not to love?”
