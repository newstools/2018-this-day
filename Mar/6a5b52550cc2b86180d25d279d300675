By Yekini Jimoh in Lokoja It was a drama yesterday when the Governor of Kogi State, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, dissolved his cabinet and less than 30 minute later, he reversed his decision. The governor who arrived in Lokoja, the state capital yesterday from Abuja, was expected to dissolve his cabinet last Saturday. However, during yesterday’s meeting at the Glass House Lokoja, the governor formerly sacked his 15 commissioners and the 21 local government administrators. He also directed that all affected officials should summit the keys of their official vehicles to the Secretary to State Government (SSG), Mrs. Folashade Arike. However,  less than 30 minutes after,  the governor reversed his decision. Rather, he said all members would continue to work with him as he directed them to maintain status quo, announcing their return to office just before the end of the meeting. The governor demanded better performance and better relationship between the appointees and the masses. Meanwhile, the Director General Media and Publicity to the governor, Mr. Kingsly Fanwo, in a chat with journalists, said: “The governor has reversed himself on the directive on dissolution.”
