The governor made the declaration at the government house Abakaliki during a security meeting with stakeholders of the two local governments with all the security chiefs in attendance. Umahi said: “If this crisis continues, there will be no more salaries in the two local government areas. I will slush the salaries of the appointees in the two communities into security problems
“Ebonyi State Government has taken over that parcel of land and anybody that enters there; it is shoot at-sight. I am directing the security agencies to arrest within the next seven days all the people that are doing the burnings and the shootings. They have to rebuild the houses they have burnt; anybody that crosses that land is guilty of 10 years imprisonment.
