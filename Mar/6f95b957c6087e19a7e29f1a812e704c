James Sowole in Akure
Even without the announcement of charges and the commencement date, the Association of Professional Bodies of Nigeria (APBN) on Monday warned the Ondo State Government against the implementation of  Land Use Charges Law, saying the issue would  cause problems like that of Lagos State which has generated controversies. The APBN Chairman in Ondo State, Mr. Gboyega Akerele, who stated this in Akure, said this was not the time for the government to impose more economic hardship on the citizens in the form of taxes. Akerele, who spoke with journalists on the 2018 Presidential Retreat of APBN, which would start tomorrow (Wednesday) in Akure,  said there was need for the government to consult stakeholders effectively on the issue.
The retreat has as its theme: ‘Repositioning the APBN: Strategies for Collaboration of Professional Bodies.’ He said stakeholders, especially landlords and professionals, need to be carried along before introducing or implementing the policy which had in recent time set Lagos State Government against its people and civil society groups. The APBN chairman pointed out that the policy would fail if Akeredolu’s administration refuses to do the needful, blaming the failure of many government’s policies in Nigeria on the refusal of policy makers and lawmakers to engage expertise of professional bodies in the country. Akerele said professionals across the country led by Dr Idris Omede would converge on Akure this week to deliberate and proffer solutions to braindrain, quackery and non-patronage of indigenous experts by government. He, however, said he was happy that the Ondo State Government said it was treading with caution on the implementation of the law. The APBN said the Akeredolu’s administration needs to engage professionals and stakeholders in the estate business before the law is implemented.
