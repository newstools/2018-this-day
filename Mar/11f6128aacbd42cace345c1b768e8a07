As part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) drive, independent fibre optic infrastructure and telecommunications services provider, Phase3 Telecom has said that its grant access portfolio is being rolled out to support local high impact health based initiatives for the under-privileged across the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) In a statement signed by its Head of Media, Mrs. Morayo Nwabufo, on behalf of the company’s CEO, Mr. Stanley Jegede in Abuja, said the initiative is principally designed to combat the disproportionate access of the poor to affordable and quality healthcare services. The statement quoted the CEO as saying: ‘’In the past four years, the scope of Phase3 health based grants have significantly increased to a greater percentage almost at par with its ICT grants portfolio, due to the obvious alarming increase in the death rate of the nation’s citizenry from causes that are less terminal or natural. ‘’It is quite disconcerting that chief causes of death beyond security and social crises often stem from treatable causes that only requires timely, effective and affordable medical care.” According to Jegede, the nation’s low global ranking in terms of human development, especially in the area of access to affordable and quality healthcare as well as standard medical facilities would improve quicker if more individuals and organizations support credible programs that focus on equal access to healthcare as government and allied agencies alone cannot resolve this. According to him, the company will ride on its partnership with the Global Initiative for Peace, Love and Care (GIPLC) to provide financial assistance to indigent patients at the Gwagwalada General Hospitals within the Federal Capital territory being the first stop; as GIPLC is a credible NGO and an organization that thrives on collective actions and is well versed in building networks that can sustainably combat healthcare disparities beyond Nigeria such as South Sudan. He said: “More so, since the scope of this partnership is to cover the medical expenses of the most vulnerable indigents at each target medical facility or centre per quarter – Phase3 resolved to deploy its health based grant for this program through GIPLC due to the fact that the NGO understands the criteria of assessment and measurability of such near complex medical aid initiatives as well as the integrity required in ensuring that grants are disbursed in the names of each beneficiary.” “It is our objective that as it continues to advocate greater quantification of individual access to affordable healthcare, and less disparity in the quality of healthcare available to especially indigent women, children, elderly, and persons with disabilities in rural areas; disadvantage communities or hubs more corporate players will join efforts for quicker results and to positively change the course of Nigeria’s healthcare sector.
