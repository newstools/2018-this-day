Once one has got the money habit, it is extremely difficult to kick it; some are overwhelmed by the habit and some simply manage to tame the habit. The latter breed is constituted by such moneyed men like Tunde Fowler. Beneath the Chairman of Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), thin veneer of modesty breathes a fabulous and sophisticated man of panache. Very few people know that Fowler has a weakness for the good life. In fact, one would have to get very close to him to know that he never dithers from acquiring the finest luxury money can buy. As you read, Fowler has scenic house in Lagos, an expensive boat and choice cars to mention a few of his enviable acquisitions. A mental calculation of how much must have gone into the purchase of such luxury leaves not a few people overwhelmed as Fowler’s boat for instance, makes some of his friends’ boats look like toys. Little wonder, men envy and wish to be him even as ladies would kill just to get a date with him.
