The Edo State Government has warned trespassers encroaching on the land marked out for the Benin Industrial Park, to desist immediately from any development work on the land, as activities are gearing up for the commencement of work on the park. The warning, contained in a statement signed by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Osarodion Ogie Esq. in Benin City Edo State, noted that relevant Geographic Information System (GIS) data have been gathered to ensure that the perimeter of the land is properly delineated. The statement said, “Individuals and groups encroaching on the land acquired by the State Government for the development of the Benin Industrial Park are warned to desist forthwith.” It added, “The state government had on September 28, 2017, put out a notice informing the public of the acquisition of the property, after which it ascertained the level of development on the land, to guard against activities of land grabbers and other miscreants. “To establish the level of development on the land at the time, the state government had earlier carried out an aerial survey of the property through the Geographic Information System (GIS) Agency. The survey revealed little development on the land.” He said government has observed that some persons are illegally moving into the land to develop private properties, warning that such people will be considered criminals and the full wrath of the law will be unleashed on them. He cautioned individuals with illegal structures on the land to stop work immediately, noting, “All those who have erected illegal structures on the property after the acquisition of the land will not be compensated, as the Development Control Unit in the Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development has been directed to commence markings on the land. He reiterated that “the area acquired for the Benin Industrial Park has been mapped and anyone developing properties on any part of the land does so at his or her own risk.”
