The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has reassured that its repositioned and rebranded platform remains the best political vehicle to return Nigeria to the path of good governance and national unity. The party said it has been aggregating opinions of its members and Nigerians at large on the way forward and has since perfected a level playing ground as no individual or group can claim ownership or control of the party under its present leadership. PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement yesterday, said the fears expressed by one of the party leaders and a former minister, Godsday Orubebe, was rather misplaced as the
issues contemplated in his open letter are no longer obtainable in the repositioned PDP. “It is also obvious to all, that our great party, under the leadership of Prince Uche Secondus, has since been thrown open to all Nigerians for equal and unhindered participation, a development that has led to the renewed interest of Nigerians on our platform as the only true vehicle to return the nation to good governance. “Furthermore, we have already moved forward by inviting members who had
left the party and the responses, which we have received so far, have been very encouraging. Not just that, our party is also receiving new members from other political parties and we will soon commence an online registration to capture the old, new and returning members with equal rights, opportunities and privileges. It noted that with the proposed membership drive through the online registration, it is certain that the party is being returned to the people, whose financial contributions would make them the true owners of the PDP. “As a political party, with mass support of Nigerians and representing all interests across the six geo-political zones, the 36 states of the federation and the FCT, our new leadership has succeeded in bringing all
our members on board and we are working together now, more than ever before, to rescue our nation from the misrule of the dysfunctional All Progressives Congress (APC),” PDP said.
