Femi Ogbonnikan in Abeokuta As part of efforts to sanitise the campus of criminal elements among its students, the management of the Ogun State Institute of Technology (OGITECH), Igbesa has wielded the big stick with the rustication of two students and suspending some others for various anti-social vices that might breach the peace of the institution. The Rector, Dr. Olufunke Akinkurolere, who disclosed this recently while addressing new students during the 12th matriculation ceremony of over 2,000 fresh students in full and part-time academic programmes, reiterated its zero tolerance for cultism, gangsterism, examination malpractices, rape, indecent dressing and other anti-social behaviours. She warned the new students not to engage in any activity capable of truncating their academic pursuits.
Akinkurolere vowed that the management would not hesitate to wield the big stick to foster discipline, adding that the violation of any rule and regulation of the institute attracts punitive measures ranging from suspension to rustication and to outright expulsion.
“You should take advantage of the school’s entrepreneurship programmes that have been designed to assist students in acquiring necessary skills needed to be employers or self-employed.” In her remarks, the Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Mrs. Modupe Mujota, charged the new students to face their studies squarely with a view to becoming productive citizens in the society.
“With the influx of industries into the state, technological skills of students would be in high demand. Work hard and get equipped with adequate technical know-how in order to provide the needed manpower required by these industries,” she said.
