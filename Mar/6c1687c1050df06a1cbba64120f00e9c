Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, praised late Dr. Ebenezer Akinluyi, for his outstanding contributions to the field of human medicine and championing the cause of the downtrodden in society. Late Akinluyi, before his death, had a distinguished career in the public and private sectors as Obstetrician and Gynecologist. He died at the age of 75. At various times, Akinluyi had served on several medical boards in the old Bendel State and Edo State, including the Edo State Health Management Board. The governor, who was represented by his Chief of Staff, Chief Taiwo Akerele, at a church service held in honour of late Dr. Akinluyi, held at the All Souls Anglican Church in Benin City, at the weekend, praised Akinluyi for advancing the cause of humanity through his career, which spanned several decades. Obaseki said, “The contributions of Akinluyi will not be forgotten in a hurry because of his selfless and humanitarian services in the health sector in Edo State. Those whose path crossed Akinluyi’s will remember him for his humility. “He was reputed for charity and using his personal resources to save the lives of patients, who could not foot medical bills. The state government and good people of Edo State will remain grateful for Dr. Akinluyi’s immense contributions to the health sector in the old Bendel and later Edo State.” According to Obaseki, “As a mark of honour to immortalise the likes of late Dr. Akinluyi, this administration will continue to initiate and implement policies aimed at improving access to quality healthcare services to Edo people.”
