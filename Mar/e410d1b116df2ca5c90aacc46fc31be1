By Gboyega Akinsanmi After a fortnight of sustained campaign against the state’s new property regime by different interest groups, the Lagos State Government has eventually reviewed the Land Use Charge payable by all property owners across the state. Specifically, the state government reduced commercial charges by 50 per cent; property occupied by owner and third party and property used for industrial and manufacturing purposes by 25 per cent and owner-occupied property by 15 per cent. The state government equally introduced instalmental payment system for property owners across all categories and completely waived penalty regime for late payment of land use charge, thereby providing additional reliefs for property owners. The Commissioner for Finance, Mr. Akinyemi Ashade, reeled out the concession to the Land Use Charge Law, 2018 while addressing a news conference at the Bagauda Kaltho Press Centre, Alausa Thursday, saying the exercise was received with mixed feelings by various interest groups who expressed serious concerns. Ashade in company with the Commissioner for Information & Strategy, Mr. Kehinde Bamigbetan; the Attorney-General & Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Adeniji Kazeem; and the Commissioner for Waterfront Infrastructure Development, Dr. Babatunde Adejare among others, noted that the state government reviewed the land use charges payable by all property owners across the state in its desire “to build world class infrastructure and improve the well-being of its citizens”.
