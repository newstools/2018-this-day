David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka Twenty four persons have been arrested by men of the Operation Clean and Healthy Anambra State, otherwise known as OCHA Brigade, for the collection of illegal revenue, using fake receipts. THISDAY gathered that the raid which took place in Onitsha weekend was in fulfillment of the State Governmentâ€™s efforts in ridding the state of illegal revenue collectors who intimidate and exploit law abiding members of the public and divert government funds. The OCHA brigade in company of members of the Nigerian Police Force, the National Security and Civil Defence Corps and the Nigerian Navy embarked on a mop up exercise at Onitsha Metropolis, targeting illegal agents who sell tickets, to commercial motorcyclists, bus drivers, and petty traders. The team visited different streets and roads in Onitsha, including Iweka Road, Owerri Road, Upper Iweka Flyover and several other places. However, the men were brazenly resisted, just as those found guilty mobilised their cronies to haul stones and broken bottles at the brigade and security forces. Those arrested were handed over to the Nigerian Police Force, at Fegge Police Station. Special Assistant in-charge of Security and Operations, OCHA Brigade, Mr. Daniel Martins, said the operation was to give a lease of life to lawful citizens to engage in their businesses without intimidation from miscreants. Some of those arrested denied engaging in the act, while others justified their actions, saying it was lack of employment that made them engage in the illegal business.
