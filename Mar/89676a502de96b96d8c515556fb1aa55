By Femi Ogbonnikan in Abeokuta No fewer than 220 patients in Ogun State have benefitted from a free-eye treatment, being offered by a foundation. The patients who were brought from 14 cities, in Osun West senatorial district, Osun State to the Eye Foundation Community Hospital, Ijebu Mushin, in Ijebu North-East Local Government Area of Ogun State, received free treatment for their various eye-related problems yesterday. The eye ailments treated, courtesy of Favour Kindness and Grace Foundation, are cataract and glaucoma. According to the initiator/facilitator of the foundation, Omo Oba Dotun Babayemi, out of 7,000 eye patients, from 10 local governments and 14 cities in Osun West senatorial district that were diagnosed of their eye status, only 220 patients that were brought to the Eye Foundation Community Hospital, Ijebu-Mushin, for various forms of eye problems were certified to have glaucoma, cataract and others.
He said the patients were brought to Ijebu-Mushin, on account of the availability of facilities that are obtainable at the premier hospital. He said the hospital can compare and compete favourably with those in the United States of America (USA), United Kingdom (UK) and other developed countries.
Besides, Babayemi stated that his foundation has so far distributed well over 14,200 pairs of eye glasses to the beneficiaries in the last five years to aid the poor people of Osun West district that are suffering from various forms of eye problems. He, however, underscored the importance of eyes as the light of the body; a development which he said, spurred him on to initiate the foundation. Babayemi added that his foundation would, in July, organise a mega medicare fare in 15 locations in Osun State that would last for a period of 30 days for the treatment of other various general health challenges of the indigenes of Osun West district.
