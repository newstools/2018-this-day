Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja Ahead of the 2019 general elections, a prophet, Ezekiel Acha, said God has promised to reshuffle Nigeria from the presidency to the local government authorities. The Abia-based prophet while addressing journalists on Saturday in Abuja said God directed him specifically to come to Abuja and deliver the message to the entire nation. He said since quarrelling and fighting, violence and killings, destruction and starvation are everywhere in the country, God said the blood of the innocent souls are crying before him day and night. Acha stated: “the sky is loaded with blood vapour and blood is flowing all over Nigeria. Yet some group of people are still killing millions and more souls, why? Because the law is weak and useless, and justices never die. I, the Almighty God will never, ever allow what happened in 1966, about 52 years ago to repeat itself anymore. For a long time I kept silent, I did not answer my people but now the time to answer them has come. “I, the Almighty God says, I am to shake this nation called Nigeria, overthrow their kingdoms and destroy all their occultic powers. Also remove and destroy all the cankerworms and reshuffle from the presidency to local government authorities. Also, destroy the groups and individuals that are responsible for the cry of my people hoping that nobody sees them, “It is time to give my people good leaders come 2019, those who will show them love, peace, unity, kindness and also bring justice to all levels and no more rulers anymore. Therefore any fortunate person that found himself or herself in any of these important positions come 2019 and goes contrary will die instantly. I the sovereign Lord and the Almighty has spoken. “I, the Almighty God is warning those cankerworms warming themselves, hoping for going back to that seat come 2019 to be careful because they are taking risk of death penalty for I am the God who given and taketh life…said the Lord,” Acha revealed.
