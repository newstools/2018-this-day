Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has tasked members of elite clubs in Edo State to support governments in advancing laws and social projects to end the scourge of human trafficking and illegal migration. Obaseki made the call when he hosted executive members of the Benin Recreation Club, at the Government House in Benin City. He said the elite culture has long disappeared from society, noting, “without defined roles for the elite, the society suffers. I am however optimistic that the Benin Recreation Club can help revive this culture.” He urged members of elite clubs to support government’s socio-economic developmental efforts in the state, noting that the support of persons in privileged positions in society for laudable social projects will benefit humanity. “When the elite speak out against issues confronting the society, such as modern-day slavery, it would go a long way to bring an end to the inhuman practice. How can we, as a people tolerate such a practice long after it was abolished? It is left for the elite to stand against this culture and ensure the preservation of human dignity,” he added. He noted that members of elite clubs have the obligation to provide leadership and direction that would spur socio-economic growth, noting, “Why it is the responsibility of governments to provide basic infrastructure, the elite must contribute to the progress of society.” Obaseki urged the club to assimilate more female members to allow for diversification of its membership and aggregate more ideas. President, Benin Recreation Club, Engr. Wilfred Aiguobosimwin Irogue, expressed appreciation to the governor for the giant strides in deepening infrastructural development. He noted, “The development of infrastructure will transform the socio-economic development of the state.”
