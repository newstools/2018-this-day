Senator Iroegbu in Abuja The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has sustained its ongoing clean-up of Voters’ Register for the 2019 general election. To this end, the commission has detected registration of ineligible persons in the ongoing Continuous Voters Registration in Taraba State. The Head of Voters Education and Publicity in the state, Mr. Fabian Yema Vwambi, in a statement yesterday, said the name of the affected persons have subsequently been removed from its register. Vwambi described registration of ineligible voters as not only contrary to the commission’s guidelines for registration, it is also a violation of the Electoral Act.
Decided not to condone illegality from its staff, he said both the Electoral Officer and Registration Officer in the affected area would be queried. In addition, Vwambi said apart from informing the national headquarters of the commission, the state INEC office has also drawn the attention of security agencies for further investigation and possible prosecution of all found culpable including INEC staff.
