Were the Diode Jing written in contemporary times, the medieval Taoist would understand that the five colours do not necessarily make a man’s eyes blind, sometimes, it awakens the soul and opens the eyes to life’s little beauties; like the beauty in a painter’s strokes and the poetry in his flurry. There is no gainsaying Nigeria parades such men; many of them are connoisseurs of high art and ardent patrons of the most gifted talents. Their love for contemporary art is only equaled by their lust for life. Little wonder they spend great fortune on artworks and craft. These exclusive band of art enthusiasts invest heavily in modern art knowing artworks appreciate over time; they know that a painting valued at N6million today could appreciate and command a price tag of N600million in a few years. This clique of art buffs include Access Bank Managing Director (MD), Herbert Wigwe and his predecessor and current chairman of the bank, Aig Imoukhuede. Aig’s case is particularly interesting; pundits wonder how the private jet owner, is able to commit time and a great fortune to collecting art even though he has a steady stream of income. Other art lovers include StillEarth boss, Oyin Adeyemi and ex-Guaranty Trust Bank MD, Fola Adeola. Evelyn Oputu and Lanre Ishola are also lovers and collectors of the most enthralling and pricey artworks. The best works of foremost artists including Negritude, Enwonwu, Mufu Onifade, Bruce Onabrapkeya to mention a few, excite their fancies.
