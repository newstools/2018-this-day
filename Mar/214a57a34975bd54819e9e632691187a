By John Shiklam in Kaduna The Kaduna State Government has given a four-week ultimatum to defaulting contractors handling the supply of furniture to public schools to deliver or face the consequences of the delay. The Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Ja‘afaru Ibrahim Sani, issued the ultimatum at the weekend  during a meeting with the contractors in his office. The commissioner who said the contracts were awarded between 2015 and 2016, added that about 52 per cent of the contractors have defaulted on the contract terms. He expressed displeasure with the contractors who, according to him, were given 50 per cent mobilisation, but failed to supply up to 50 per cent of the expected furniture. Sani said the four weeks window was to give the defaulting contractors opportunity to make things right. He warned that any contractor who failed to meet up with the four weeks deadline would face the wrath of the law. The commissioner said the state government was doing everything possible to provide conducive learning environment in its public schools and was determined to ensure that the objective is successful. “So every contractor is expected to meet up with the terms of agreement. If we have given you 50 per cent of the contract sum, give us furniture commensurate with the amount advanced paid. “You are already behind schedule, but we are willing to let that go for the interest of progress so that we don’t have a failed project. I therefore, implore you to do the needful and save yourself embarrassment,” the commissioner warned.
