President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday extended his “sincere congratulations” to President Vladimir Putin of Russia on his victory in the country’s recent presidential election. The president also congratulated German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, on her re-election.
In two separate statements, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, said the president addressed letters of goodwill to both leaders on behalf of himself, government and people of Nigeria. The president said Putin’s “success for the fourth time in the election is a clear testimony of the confidence” Russians have in his leadership, urging him to “see this victory as a base to continue to promote international peace and stability.” He also assured Putin of “Nigeria’s commitment to a stronger and mutually beneficial relation with the Russian Federation under your watch.”
The president said he looked forward to continuously working with the Russian leader “to strengthen our defence, trade and technical partnerships as well as promotion of private sector participation in all sectors of our economies.” The president, according to another statement by Adesina, congratulated Merkel on her re-election for another term, saying he was “most delighted to learn of the successful conclusion of the inter-party negotiations to form a new government after the last election in Germany.” He said Merkel’s victory “is a testimony of your hard-work, competence and trust of the German people, qualities which are much admired in many parts of the world especially here in Africa” adding that “we greatly value your humanity and concern for refugees,” and “a successful new term of office.”
He added: “We look forward to greater cooperation between our two countries as we strive to confront shared challenges.”
