Among the former first ladies in Nigeria, Mrs. Derin Osoba, wife of a former governor of Ogun State, Aremo Olusegun Osoba, still  commands a lot of respect.
When her husband held the reins of power in Ogun State, her good looks was always a subject of attraction, as celebrity journalists scrabbled over one another for pictures for their cover pages.
Though he is now advanced in age, her husband has remained very stylish, thereby making the couple two of a kind. They are fashion conscious and whatever they wear surely look good on them. Besides, their ranking in the social scene is also something to write home about. Their presence at high-octane events has never gone unnoticed.
Though the elegant former first lady could be said to be selective about social events she attends, she was an attraction last weekend at a party in Lagos where she danced her heart out
“The former first lady was an attraction last weekend as she danced to the music of King Sunny Ade. Many were amazed at her dance steps; she is, indeed, a very good dancer,” a source said.
