Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) club, Kwara United on Monday announced the sacking of their Technical Adviser, John Obuh, from the post. Former Niger Tornadoes gaffer, Abubakar Bala, has been tipped as Obuh’s possible replacement. In an official press statement issued by Media Officer of the club, Waheed Bibire, the Ilorin club was forced to take such drastic decision following the team’s poor run of form in the NPFL this season. Kwara United has stuck to the bottom of the 12-week old season with a miserly11 points from a possible 36. Before the former Flying Eagles coach was sacked yesterday, Obuh was given a three-match ultimatum to turn the fortunes of the team around following a 1-0 home defeat against Rivers United on Match-day 10. The team was have however recorded one defeat and a draw since the ultimatum. Obuh, who once handled Nigeria’s U-17 and U-20 teams, last game in charge of Kwara United was last Sunday’s Match-day 12 clash against El-Kanemi Warriors which ended in a 1-1 draw. He guided the club back to the top flight last term after two seasons in the Bet9ja Nigeria National League. He is the second coach to be relieved of his duties in the NPFL in this campaign after Niger Tornadoes sacked veteran tactician Erasmus Onu earlier in the season.
