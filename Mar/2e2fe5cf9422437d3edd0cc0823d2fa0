The former Governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi, has called on Nigerians to eschew nepotism and encourage the culture of merit. Obi spoke at the weekend during the public presentation of “One Faith, Many Tongues: Managing Diversity in the Church in Nigeria”, written by Archbishop Fortunatus Nwachukwu, the Papal Nuncio to Trinidad & Tobago  at the Resource Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. Describing  nepotism as one of the worst forms of corruption, the former governor said  it killed merit thereby stunting the growth of any institution where it was allowed to flourish by elevating the bad while demoting the good. Obi said any country that elevated nepotism as Nigeria does in politics, places of work and amongst religious bodies, would not make meaningful progress in any sphere of life because, according to him, “it kills hard work and professionalism as people’s hard work  would  not match their opportunities.” The book presentation which witnessed the presence of Archbishop Martins Adewale of Archdiocese of Lagos;  Prof. Theresa Okure; and Prof. Paulinus Odozor, Dr. ABC Orjiakor, was reviewed by Prof. Pat Utomi
