  Global anti-corruption watchdog, Transparency International recently released its Corruption Perception Index 2017, where Nigeria slid 12 places from 136th to 148th out of the 180 countries ranked, although the country scored 28 points out of 100 in 2017; compared to 26 points in 2016. Although the federal government has disputed the negative ranking, analysts believe the current administration’s anti-corruption war has not effectively checked the scourge. To you, has corruption really declined or increased in Nigeria? What can be done?    ABIMBOLA AKOSILE    * Corruption cannot just decline overnight and Nigerians must see the fight against corruption as a collective responsibility. – Mr. Feyisetan Akeeb Kareem, Coordinator, CDHR, Delta State  * Yes, the monster called corruption has declined in Nigeria. The brazen looting of public treasuries we saw in the past no longer exists. The fight should be holistic. I recommend four simple approaches: 1. Spare no one in this fight; 2. Get all public officers from 1960 to date to return whatever they stole; 3. Confiscate properties home and abroad acquired through looted funds; 4. EFCC should learn from Singapore on how to fight corruption. God bless Nigeria. – Mr. Odey Ochicha, Leadership Specialist, Abuja  * To me corruption has declined, but government must intensify efforts on it. – Mr. Yusuf Muh’dBashir Omotayo, Nda-Aliu, Kwara State  * Corruption has not declined in Nigeria. To curtail corruption, we must devise an inclusive and conclusive anti-graft policy; we must first build human capacity, empower Nigerians and perpetuate a social security solution that guarantees all law abiding and hard working citizens the dividends of a corrupt-free Nigeria. God bless Nigeria. – Mr. Ekpa Stanley Ekpa, author, Nigerian Law School, Abuja  * Just like politics in Nigeria, corruption has only changed its looks to suit the trend, and lip service will continue to do us no good. Rethinking our values and committing to these right from the home front, will set our society straight again no matter how long it takes. – Ms Nkeiruka Abanna, Lagos State  * Not at all; corruption is rather on the increase in Nigeria. What do you say of a president who has all his security heads connected to him in one way or the other? Our leader’s men feed him with lies, creating the impression that the last administration’s leaders were the corrupt ones. This government only fights corruption by mouth and worse is yet to come. – Hon. Babale Maiungwa, U/Romi, Kaduna  * Corruption has increased in Nigeria because government is busy chasing shadows instead of checking and blocking avenues of corruption. They keep antagonising the opposition and former leaders and at the same time posting their cronies to lucrative places to steal while the President himself continues to defend them. – Mr. Umoru Sabo, Lafia, Nasarawa State  * There is no political will and the rate of corruption has increased. While government was able to implement the Treasury Single Account, government agencies like the EFCC, the ICPC, Code of Conduct Bureau, NEITI, Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit are not being empowered. There is need for effective investigation, prevention, education, good governance, transparency, accountability, private and public anti-corruption initiatives. – Mr. Michael Adedotun Oke, Founder Michael Adedotun Oke Foundation, Federal Capital Territory, Abuja  * No; this administration has obviously kept a blind eye on corruption e.t.c with high profile cases of corruption driving Nigeria underground while patriotic whistleblowers, glaring evidence, and self confessions e.t.c are ignored. Nigerians are apprehensive of where this anti-graft war is actually heading now. Only the poor masses face jungle justice. The best time to act is now. – Miss Apeji Patience Eneyeme, Badagry, Lagos State  * Before assumption of office, many Nigerians believed that the President will stamp out corruption from the polity but regrettably his inability to rein in his appointees, ostensibly due to political, ethnic and religious consideration, has bastardised the anti-corruption campaign. Transparency International’s assessment of the corruption situation in Nigeria is on point. – Mr. Paul Jideofor. Dept. of Languages, FCT COE, Zuba, Abuja  * Even if the newsmen won’t talk about it again, it is visible to the blind that corruption has not reduced a bit. We can’t keep deceiving ourselves that it has reduced. It’s a blatant lie. How many members of the current cabinet have been prosecuted? Let’s wait till they leave office again; we will then know if it has reduced or not. – Mr. Adewumi Temitope, Agroshowroom, Osun State  * Corruption is on the increase. There is uncertainty in the polity and lots of deprivation resulting in increase in poverty level and fear of the future. More importantly the agencies have not been effective and the government officials have not shown good examples to curb the mess. Let every citizen shun corruption starting from our immediate environment. – Mr. Kingsley Oparah, Lagos State  * Yes and no. Those who are not in the innermost of government circles feel circumspect about dipping their fingers in the till – they are not sure which way the hammer will swing when it falls. However, there’s a kind of ‘swag’ exuding from those in government circles; they feel Mr. President is too close a family member to do them harm. This administration should be wary of this class of Nigerians. – Mr. E. Iheanyi Chukwudi, B.A.R., Apo, Abuja  * No, it hasn’t. Although efforts have been mustered by this administration, saboteurs and elitist thieving collaborators have repeatedly thwarted concerted efforts to kill corruption today. Our judicial system has made it very easy for high profile plunderers to escape justice; hence nobody has been truly convicted or punished yet. It’s apt time to rid our judicial system of bad eggs. We must act now and swiftly. – Mr. Apeji Onesi, Lagos State  * Corruption has most certainly reclined in Nigeria. There is still stealing going on but not at the scale it was before. With TSA and higher remittances from MDAs it’s not as easy as it used to be to get your hands on corrupt money. Prosecution and speedy trials have still not improved much but blocking of leakages has greatly reduced the access to filthy lucre. During the immediate past administration, we had convictions where those accused of embezzling billions of pension funds were sentenced to fines of N500,000 and N750,000 respectively. Unfortunately, stealing is still rampant today but not at the level of unraveling the nation. – Mr. Buga Dunj, Jos, Plateau State  * To me, corruption has reduced but it is still very virulent in Nigeria. Across public and private sectors in the country, it was a way of life until the current administration came in and declared war on corruption. However, sadly enough, corruption is fighting back even at the top level of government. To conquer the cankerworm, all citizens must fight it together. – Mr. Olumuyiwa Olorunsomo, Lagos State         THE FEEDBACK Yes, it has reduced: 4 No, it has not reduced: 9 Others: 3 Radical tip: Overhaul judiciary!

Although the National Assembly recently recommended and approved Local Government autonomy in their amendment process, the move does not sit well with State Governors, who largely control the finances accruing to the local councils. In your own view, should local governments in Nigeria be granted full autonomy to boost development at the grassroots or not?
