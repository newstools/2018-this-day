Senator Iroegbu in Abuja The Social Democratic Party (SDP) has concluded plans to inaugurate two special bodies in the party hierarchy for the women and youth – Youth Parliament and Women Parliament –, respectively. The National Secretary, SDP, Alhaji Shehu Musa Gabam, in a statement yesterday, said this is part of the party’s efforts to ensure that the youth and women are actively mainstreamed into the political and governance processes in the country. Gabam said the SDP strongly believes that the Nigerian women and youth remain critical elements in nation building, and yet are among the most vulnerable and untapped resources in the Nigerian governance mix. He said to effectively tap into this great resource base, the party has initiated these two powerful platforms to facilitate wider and deeper inclusiveness, engagement and participation of the women and youth. “Membership process for both parliaments commences from the polling unit, to the ward, local government, state, zonal, and national levels. The Women and Youth Leaders of the party will serve as leaders of the parliaments, as they sit at the various levels; where they are expected to discuss, debate and advise the leadership of the party on creative and innovative solutions for reinventing our nationhood,” he stated. Gabam stressed that the SDP as “The Main Force” in opposition politics in Nigeria today, remains committed to its ideal of being a genuine grassroots party, with enough room for women, youth, and civil society organisations at all levels.
