As the sea anemone attaches itself to the sturdiest boulder in the Atlantic, so does the random socialite, political lobbyist, power broker or social butterfly attach himself or herself to the most powerful social and political titan. Little wonder, friends, family and political associates trooped to the Olusegun Obasanjo Library, Abeokuta, to celebrate former President Olusegun Obasanjo as he clocked 81. Like clams and corals gravitating in the deep, towards the tide without a storm, the creme of Nigeria’s high society trooped out to party with Obasanjo despite his established distaste for grand festivities. There is no gainsaying that the former president is hardly given to grand frivolities. He is not one to indulge in extravagant activities, as confirmed by him years ago. Obasanjo also confirmed that he is not given to celebrating his birthdays since any of his birthdays is just like any other day of his life. But he had a different story to tell as he celebrated his 81st birthday. Interestingly, Obasanjo broke tradition from his well-known anathema to birthday celebrations to host his 80th birthday at the prestigious Eko Hotel and Suites, Lagos, with King Sunny Ade on the bandstand, last year. Expectedly, Nigeria’s superrich men and women, politicians and celebrities who made good during his time as the president filed out to celebrate with their benefactor. And King Sunny Ade didn’t disappoint them at all. Obasanjo, took a retrospective look at his life as he clocked 81 years on Monday, and lamented that his parents did not live long enough to reap the fruits of their labour on him. He noted that it was “sad and regrettable” that despite the sacrifices they made on him, they did not live long to also share and be part of his success story.
