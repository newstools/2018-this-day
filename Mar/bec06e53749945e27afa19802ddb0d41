Dana Air has announced that lovers of the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) teams will stand a chance of winning return air tickets at the rescheduled first leg encounter between Akwa United and Heartland FC on March 21 in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. According to Dana Air’s Media and Communications Manager, Kingsley Ezenwa, the initiative is to encourage more people to follow the Nigerian league teams and also encourage them to visit the venues of these matches to cheer the teams to victory. “We are trying to encourage more people to follow our Nigerian teams, players, and also visit the venue of these matches to cheer their teams to victory. So we shall be giving out return tickets to lucky football fans and spectators at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo and during the return leg in Owerri.”
