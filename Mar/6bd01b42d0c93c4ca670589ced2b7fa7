The equities market depreciated further yesterday as decline by bellwether stocks dragged the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index to shed 1.53 per cent to close at 42,185.38. Despite the release of improved 2017 results by three banks and some companies, investors’ sentiments remained negative. The depreciation recorded in the share prices of Transcorp, Dangote Cement, Zenith Bank, UBA, and Access Bank were mainly responsible for the decline recorded. However, 39 stocks depreciated yesterday, while only 15 stocks appreciated. Commenting on the performance, analysts at FSDH Merchant Bank said: “The sustained sell pressure particularly in banking sector stocks resulted in a number of stocks on offer at the lower limit. Market outlook remains positive with the possibility of a rebound as investors take advantage of low valuations.” Also commenting, analysts at Meristem Securities Limited said: “The market mood has been predominantly bearish this week, save for the positive close on Tuesday, which was driven by the gain on Dangote Cement Plc. There were notable selloffs on banking stocks as the release of positive results by some of the Tier-1 banks has failed to sway investor sentiment towards the sector. We envisage some bargain hunting on some of these counters, given their relatively low prices.” Fidelity Bank Plc led the 39 decliners with 9.2 per cent, trailed by Japaul Oil & Maritime Services Plc with 8.7 per cent. Unilever Nigeria Plc shed 8.4 per cent, while Consolidated Hallmark Insurance Plc went down by7.5 per cent.
