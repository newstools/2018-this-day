GOTV BOXING NIGHT 14 Prince “Lion” Nwoye, the fast-rising lightweight boxer has vowed to end the unbeaten run of Oto “Joe Boy” Joseph, reigning African Boxing Union and Commonwealth Africa lightweight champion, when they meet at GOtv Boxing Night 14 slated to hold on 14 April at the Indoor Sports Hall of the National Stadium, Lagos. Nwoye, a fast-punching boxer, said Joe Boy has enjoyed an unbeaten run because he is yet to come up against him since they both turned professional. As amateurs, he said, he used to beat Joe Boy for fun, a trick he has vowed to repeat at GOtv Boxing Night 14. “I will show him that I am a policeman. I was beating him while we were in the amateur ranks and I will beat him again. After beating him, I will handcuff him, so he would know that I am a policeman,” bragged Nwoye. Responding to his opponent’s taunting, Joe Boy said he will make Nwoye understand that the boxing ring is not an extension of the police station. He dismissed Lion’s claim as an impotent threat, saying being the African and Common wealth lightweight champion shows that he is many tiers above Nwoye. “For saying he used to beat me during amateur trials, I will beat him so much that the Police Force will have no option than dismiss him for the shame he will bring on the institution. I do not want to waste my time talking about an insignificant boxer, who will not last the distance,” the champion boasted. GOtv Boxing Night 14 will feature a total of seven fights, including the African Boxing Union featherweight title bout between Nigeria’s Waidi “Skoro” Usman and Michael Nyawade of Kenya as well as the West African Boxing Union welterweight title bout between Djossou “Agoy” Basile of the Republic of Benin and Nigeria’s Rilwan “Baby Face” Oladosu. A national lightweight boxing title bout is also scheduled. It will feature the flamboyant Rilwan “Real One” Oladosu against Kazeem “Ijoba” Badmus. The event will be broadcast live on SuperSport in 47 African countries.
