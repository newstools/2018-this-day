Former Governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi, thursday lamented the poor leadership in Nigeria, saying it was responsible for the backwardness in the country. Obi, who spoke while delivering a speech at a dialogue organised by Ripples Centre for Data and Investigative Journalism in Lagos, berated the leadership for poor performance, wondering at what point did the country get things wrong? “Unexamined life is not worth living. That we are divided is not the issue, but how did we get here? If you look at what is happening today; we have crisis. Issues of security of all forms and truly we have economy that is heading south. “What we are going through is a cumulative effect of bad leadership failures. The main critical component of governance is trust. After campaigning that this is what you are going to do and you get there, you start talking of what you met there. While we do not want 100 percent result, we want 100 per cent effort,” Obi stated.
