To end the menace of human trafficking in Edo State,  the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, in conjunction with traditional priests in the kingdom have placed curses on those aiding and abetting the illicit trade in the state. Also cursed were the native doctors who subject victims of human trafficking to oath of secrecies, violators of the order banning Community Development Associations and others whose business is to initiate the sons and daughters of the land into various cult groups. Those who took part in the swearing exercise were the Ohen Okhuae, Ohen Ovia, Ohen noriyekeogba, Ohen Ake, Ohen Niwuo, Native Doctors, Ohen Sango,  Odionwere, Iwueki and the Enigies. Oba Ewuare said those aiding and abetting human trafficking through the use of black magic and subjecting them to the oath of secrecies should desist from it henceforth or face the wrath of the gods. According to the monarch, “You native doctors whose business are to subject people to the oath of secrecies and encouraging this evil act on the land, you have to repent, stop doing it. This is not a joking matter and if you do not repent, you have to wait for the repercussion”.
