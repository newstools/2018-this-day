The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday grilled former Governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, over allegation of corruption and diversion of funds during the 2015 elections. Speaking with THISDAY, EFCC Head of Media and Publicity, Wilson Uwujaren, said: “He responded to an invite and was quizzed.” Though Uwujaren did not provide details, he however, added that Sheriff “is to return for further questioning tomorrow (today).” Sheriff’s invitation might not be unconnected with the probe of former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mrs. Diezani Alison-Madueke 2015 election largess. Sheriff was alleged to have received N450 million from Alison-Madueke as part of the funds for Borno State during the 2015 general election. He had previously been invited by the EFCC for interrogation on the matter
His current visit may be a move by the commission to dig deeper in the $115 (N23) election funds scandal. Sheriff was governor of Borno State between 2003 and 2011 under the then All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP), and was a power broker in the state within the period. In 2015, Sheriff suddenly parted ways with the All Progressives Congress (APC) and defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He was later appointed interim National Chairman of the PDP, plunging the party into crisis, which ended at the Supreme Court, with the court sacking him.
