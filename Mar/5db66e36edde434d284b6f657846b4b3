The sprawling city of Ikorodu, near Lagos, will friday be locked down with a gospel music festival, tagged: ‘Embrace.’ It is the 11th edition of the yearly musical crusade that draws about half a million Christians and non-Christians to the city. It is themed: Embrac 11
As he has done most of the past 11 years, juju music legend and gospel music maestro, Ebenezer Obey Fabiyi, leads the pack of top gospel artistes that will rock the city from dusk till dawn on Good Friday. Other topflight artistes on the bill are Tope Alabi, Chioma Jesus, Tim Godfrey, Tolu David, Battle Axe, Vickel, Olori Oladapo, The Spirit and Life Choir, and Olubukola. The programme holds at the sprawling grounds of Ikorodu Town Hall.
Speaking to journalists at a parley, Pastor Isaac Adeyemi, Senior Pastor of Embrace International Assembly, Ikorodu, mastermind of the musical crusade, said that the music extravaganza would be preceded, in the morning, by a health outreach in which scores of people would be given free medical examination and treatment. In the evening, the hundreds of thousands of people expected at the flagship event will be serenaded with rapturous gospel music never before seen or experienced in Lagos State. Adeyemi also hinted that over the past 11 years, the Embrace musical crusade has induced several developmental projects in and around the town, as well as Lagos State. The projects are executed and solely financed by the church. Bro. Segun Onakoya, chairman, organising committee of Embrace, corroborated Adeyemi, disclosing that this year’s musical crusade will be phenomenal in every ramification. “Like we have been doing over the years,” Onakoya assures, “Embrace will bring down God’s glory to Ikorodu, Lagos and Nigeria in a manner never before experienced. God will visit Nigeria through this programme, and revive millions of souls languishing in economic, social and spiritual in recession.”
