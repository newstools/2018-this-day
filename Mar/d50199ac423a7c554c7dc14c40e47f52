 By Gboyega Akinsanmi  Confronted with the unacceptable incidence of sexual violence in the state, the Lagos State Governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, has recommended a minimum jail term of 25 years for any person tried and found guilty of sexual violence.  Ambode thus challenged the state House of Assembly to amend the Protection against Domestic Violence Law, 2007 to accommodate stiffer penalty for convicts of sexual violence, noting that rape should not be met with a light sentence.  He strongly canvassed stiffer penalty for convicts of sexual violence after a peaceful march against domestic and sexual violence at the state Assembly, Ikeja Monday, noting that domestic violence at large “is a crime, and should be treated as such”.  The march, which terminated at the state House of Assembly, had the Secretary to the State Government, Mr. Tunji Bello; the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Adeniji Kazeem; the Chief Judge of Lagos State, Justice Opeyemi Oke; and the Coordinator of the state Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team, Mrs. Titilola Vivour-Adeniyi, among others in attendance.  After the march against domestic violence, Ambode said rape “should not be met with light sentencing. The minimum sentence of 25 years is highly recommended. We need new laws, which will respond adequately to the nature and occurrences of this era”.  He noted that domestic violence “is a crime, and should be treated as such. The Protection against Domestic Violence Law, 2007 should therefore be amended accordingly”. Details later…
