Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has tasked members of elite clubs in the state to support governments in advancing laws and social projects to end the scourge of human trafficking and illegal migration.  Obaseki made the call when he hosted executive members of the Benin Recreation Club, at the Government House in Benin City. He said the elite culture had long disappeared from society, noting, “without defined roles for the elite, the society suffers. I am however optimistic that the Benin Recreation Club can help revive this culture.”  He urged members of elite clubs to support government’s socio-economic developmental efforts in the state, noting that the support of persons in privileged positions in society for laudable social projects would benefit humanity.
