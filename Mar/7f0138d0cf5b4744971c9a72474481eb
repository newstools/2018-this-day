By Mohammed Aminu in Sokoto The Sokoto State Government Wednesday said it has devised strategies to tackle the current water scarcity bedevilling the state capital and some major towns across the state. It also pleaded with residents of the state to be patient as everything is being done to address the problem. Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal stated this when he inspected the water levels at Goronyo dam which experts say have depleted by as much as 90 per cent of its installed one billion-cubic-metre capacity. Speaking after the inspection, Tambuwal described the depletion of the dam’s water level as alarming, adding: “The reservoir of Goronyo Dam was constructed to hold one billion cubic metres of water but as we have seen today, the water in it is just about 100 million cubic metres. “This has resulted in inadequate supply to the water board and in effect, we had to resort to rationing water to the people. We have however adopted proactive measures to boost supply to the people pending when the rains will come and increase the volume of water in the dam. “I have directed the state water board to immediately reactivate 12 boreholes in Sokoto metropolis and build additional ones to supplement what we get from other sources.” Details later…
