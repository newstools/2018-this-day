By Paul Obi in Abuja The federal government yesterday said the statement credited to former Minister of Defence, Gen. Theophilus Danjuma (rtd), was an invitation to anarchy and a resort to unconstitutional means. Danjuma had during the convocation of Taraba State University urged Nigerians to defend themselves against killers herdsmen on a killing prowl in Taraba State and other parts of the country. Danjuma also accused the army of bias and colluding with killers to cause havoc across the country. Responding, the Minister of Defence, Brig-Gen Mansur Dan-Ali (rtd), speaking through his media aide, Col. Tukur Gusau, said: “The attention of the Ministry of Defence was drawn to a recent comment by one of the elder statesmen alleging that the military collude with bandits to kill people and therefore, call on them to rise and defend themselves outside constitutional provisions. “This is highly uncalled for and is invitation to anarchy and should be disregarded by  well meaning Nigerians.” Gusau added that “the efforts of the  Nigerian Armed Forces towards restoration of peace, security and order in Nigeria  are evidently clear and Nigerians continue to show appreciation for changing the security environment from what it was before. “The Nigerian armed forces is well organised and highly  professional in discharging its constitutional mandate. “Therefore, if any one has evidence of wrongdoings or dereliction of duty against our troops should please bring forward such evidence through the appropriate channels for necessary action.” He stressed that “for the avoidance of doubt, the military will not be distracted from performing its statutory duties in accordance with the rules of engagement. “Nigerians should please continue to support the military so that all security challenges will be overcome within the shortest possible time,” Gusau submitted.
