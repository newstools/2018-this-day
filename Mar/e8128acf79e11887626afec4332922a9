Isco scored a hat-trick as Spain warmed up for the 2018 World Cup by crushing 2014 finalists Argentina in Madrid. Spain raced into a 2-0 lead when Diego Costa stabbed past Sergio Romero before Isco side-footed his first goal. Argentina, without injured forward Lionel Messi, pulled it back to 2-1 through Nicolas Otamendi’s header. Isco and Thiago Alcantara extended the lead to 4-1, with substitute Iago Aspas adding the fifth before Isco completed his hat-trick. Spain are now unbeaten in 18 games since Julen Lopetegui took charge following their exit at the first knockout stage of Euro 2016. They have two more friendlies, against Switzerland and Tunisia, before they launch their World Cup group campaign against European champions Portugal on 15 June. Lopetegui’s side look a major threat on this evidence as they scored with all six shots on target. Barcelona defender Gerard Pique, who supported the recent Catalan independence referendum, ignored jeers each time he touched the ball in Madrid’s Wanda Metropolitano to produce a solid performance at the back. Andres Iniesta was outstanding in midfield, Isco showed his threat in front of goal and Aspas also did enough to suggest he should make the plane to Russia.
