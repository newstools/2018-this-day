The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has signed an agreement with a civil society organisation (CSO) in the legal industry – Justice Research Institute (JRI), to improve the level of representation for indigent Nigerians in law courts at minimal or no costs to them. The agreement which was consummated on Friday in Abuja between the President of NBA, Mr. Abubakar Mahmoud (SAN), and the Executive Director of JRI, Mr. Ikem Isiekwena, would see JRI set up a framework that would aggregate all demands for legal services from indigents such as market women; rape victims; and unlawfully jailed persons, for take up and representation by lawyers in the country. The MoU, according to Isiekwena, was crafted with the recognition of the shortfalls in the ability of the Legal Aid Council of Nigeria to adequately provide legal representation for all Nigerians who need one but could not afford to pay heavily for it. He also noted that this was in line to bridge the increasing gap in the demands for and supply of legal services as Nigeria’s population continues to increase.
