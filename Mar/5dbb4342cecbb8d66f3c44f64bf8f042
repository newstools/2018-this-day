President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday extended his heartfelt condolences to the Abebe family as well as the government and people of Edo State on the death of Dr. Christopher Abebe, aged 99. In a statement, his media adviser, Mr. Femi Adesina, said Buhari also commiserated with the in-laws, friends, the organised private sector and the Iruekpen community in Edo State over the passage of the astute and dedicated community leader and business mogul. He said the president believed that as the Odionwere (community leader) of Iruekpen, the first indigenous Chairman and Managing Director of United Africa Company (UAC), Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Council of three Nigerian Universities (Benin, Nsukka and Calabar), Abebe was a shining light and worthy example of hard work, positive influence and patriotism to his local community, the private sector and the nation. “The President urges family members, business associates and the Catholic Church in Nigeria where he served committedly as Papal Knight of St Gregory and Supreme Knight of St. Mulumba to honour Dr. Abebe’s memory by upholding his lifelong dedication and passion to human development. “The President prays that Almighty God will grant the soul of the departed eternal rest and comfort all who mourn him,” the statement added.
