Koko Pee will be performing alongside the likes of Wizkid, Tekno, Davido and other wave making acts at the Warri mega fiesta holding in Warri on the 1st of April. According to Koko Pee whose father warned him to make it in five years or he will lose it, studying Engineering in the university has helped him to be able to “calculate” properly in the music industry, adding that it has not been easy for his parents to accept him as an entertainer. “Watching your child stray from a career path that was paid so much for, to a path unknown to you is never easy and this was the fate of my parents”, the artiste noted. “My father who’s financially established and an engineer from the rich oil region of the South South, Delta State in particular was left with no option when I started showing interest in music.” Koko said further. Although not fully convinced on the sustainability of the industry, his father pressured him into agreeing to a “make it in five years or lose it ” condition . After all formalities and initial challenges things are beginning to fall into position for him in High places, last year, Koko Pee released a viral and successful single featuring Ushbebe and his current single “No Underrate” featuring Terry Apala is enjoying massive rotation on radio and good reviews on social media, which has helped to consolidate his buzz in the music scene.
