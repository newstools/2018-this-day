By Bassey Inyang in Calabar About 10 people have been killed as a result of a communal clash between Okwabang and Beebo Communities in Boki Local Government Area of Cross River State. Sources from the affected communities, about 300 kilometres from the state capital, Calabar, indicated that the clash which occurred at the weekend, followed a dispute over the ownership of a parcel of land between both communities. One of the sources from the area disclosed that both communities have been at logger-heads over the ownership of the parcel of land for ages. The source stated that open hostilities between both communities began last week when Beebo community allegedly harvested farm produce from the parcel of land claimed by a man from Okwabang. The source said following the dispute that ensued because of the alleged harvest from the farm, the situation degenerated and resulted to violent confrontation between both communities. The source said as at yesterday morning, about 10 people had been killed from the fierce fighting between both communities. However, the police in the state put the number of those who lost their lives from the communal clash at three. “The information we have is that only three have been killed. We have only been able to confirm two,” the state Commissioner of Police, Hafiz Inuwa, said while reacting to enquire about the incident. The commissioner said the police command had deployed regular and riot policemen from Calabar, and the neighbouring local government areas to Boki to quell the conflict. Inuwa said soldiers have also joined in the trouble-shooting mission to restore calm in the area. He disclosed that representatives of both communities had a peace meeting yesterday, and another meeting which he described as a “grand peace meeting”, where he would be represented by the Deputy Commissioner of Operations would hold today.
