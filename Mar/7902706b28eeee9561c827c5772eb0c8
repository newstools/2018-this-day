Super Falcons have left out top star Asisat Oshoala, but Desire Oparanozie and Rita Chikwelu, who led the team to win the last women’s AFCON, have been picked for next month’s high-profile friendly against France. The eight –time African champions are up against their French counterparts at the Stade MMArena in the city of Le Mans, France on Friday, April 6, 2018. Coach Thomas Dennerby, whose maidens composed entirely of home-based professionals took third place at the WAFU Women Cup of Nations in Abidjan in February following penalty shoot-out defeat by Ghana in the semi finals, will have the complement of foreign –based gladiators as well when they pitch battle with France as from 9pm on Friday next week. Nigeria’s 17-woman list includes Rita Chikwelu, who captained the team to win an eighth continental title in Cameroon in December 2016, as well as big forward Desire Oparanozie, the effervescent Francisca Ordega, nimble –footed midfielder Ngozi Okobi and home-based goalkeepers Onyinyechukwu Okeke and Chiamaka Nnadozie. U.S-based forward Courtney Dike and Ordega would be first arrivals in Le Mans on Tuesday, 3rd April – the same day the delegation from Nigeria will depart from the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. The Super Falcons will lodge at the Mercure Le Mans Centre.
