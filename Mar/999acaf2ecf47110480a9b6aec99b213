David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka
The Minister of Transport, Hon Chibuike Amaechi will tomorrow deliver the Nnamdi Azikiwe University convocation lecture to mark the 12th convocation of the institution. The Vice Chancellor of the university, Prof Joseph Ahaneku, stated this yesterday  at a press conference to mark the commencement of the convocation ceremony, saying that Amaechi would be speaking on the topic: ‘Igbos in the   politics of Nigeria.’ Ahaneku said the choice of Amaechi was because of his bluntness and his ability to be vocal, and that it is expected that his lecture would stimulate consciousness among the Igbos and Nigerians in general.
The vice chancellor also added that Amaechi was known for his hard work as is evident in the new light rail project, and that it is expected that his lecture would stimulate the consciousness of the students of the university too. Nnamdi Azikiwe University would on March 22 confer various degrees on 7,732 students of the university, ranging from first degrees, post graduate diplomas, masters degrees and doctor of philosophy degrees.
Ahaneku said of the 6,641 students to be awarded first degrees, 54 of them bagged first class in various disciplines. He said since assuming office, he has worked tirelessly to ensure that the university achieved partnerships with diverse universities of the world that would help its students be self reliant and sought after upon graduation.
“We have also set up factories here in the university so that part of the things we say in the classrooms will be done practically for the students to learn. “We procure raw materials using our own resources, and we have been making good use of them, and people are testifying that our products are some of the very best here. We have plastic manufacturing company, a bakery, paint factory and others,” Ahaneku stated.
