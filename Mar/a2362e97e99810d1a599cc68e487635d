Nike Osinowo’s television talk show was supposed to be as bright as a dawn of hope after the spell of a long, horrid night; perhaps it would be if it wasn’t as dull as ditch water. This sad reality becomes the lot of the former beauty queen and socialite whose TV show was severally over-hyped prior to its debut. Despite the hype that heralded her entrance into the world of television magazine programmes, Nike is yet to effect that promising spark characteristic of a brash and able neophyte trying her hands in a tasking field. Contrary to initial expectations about her ability to rattle and compete effectively with established broadcasters and TV talk show hosts and entrepreneurs, Nike has failed to shine.
