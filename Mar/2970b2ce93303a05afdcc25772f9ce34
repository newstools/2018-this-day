Yekini Jimoh in Lokoja The Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, may today Sunday dissolve the State Executive Council and other political appointees, following the importation of Military uniforms scandal rocking the governor. THISDAY reliably gathered yesterday that the governor is no more comfortable with 90 per cent of his cabinet members, following the discovery of the importation of the Military uniforms and other Military prohibited goods by Senator Dino Melaye. According to a top source, the issue rattled the governor and put him under pressure to dissolve his cabinet and appoint those he believes will keep their mouths shut and work with him in the next two years. Also the governor is expected to dissolve all the 21 local government council administrators, according to the information. The reason for this, the source noted, was to allow for the function of another ad hoc arrangement following the expiration of the tenure of the Council Administrators in April, since democratic elections are said not to be feasible at the councils, all the local government administrators may also be dropped; although a new interim arrangement may be put in place with some of the former Administrators reappointed under another nomenclature. The source further added that arrangements have been concluded for the dissolution of the cabinet and sack of the council administrators at a meeting the governor had convened to hold for all appointees by 3:00pm on Saturday at the government house, but which has been postponed till today by 3pm. The source said the reason for shifting the meeting from Saturday to Sunday was because the governor who was in Abuja could not arrive the state on Saturday for the meeting and that was why the meeting was shifted to today (Sunday).
