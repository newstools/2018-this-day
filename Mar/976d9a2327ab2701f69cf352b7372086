Martins Ifijeh The newly inaugurated Governing Council of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has called for human and infrastructural boost for the agency if it must adequately safeguarding the health of Nigerians. It said the poor infrastructural facilities and the 3,000 staff strength of the agency are not commensurate with the task the agency is saddled with. Stating this in a press conference wednesday, the Chairman of the Council, Hon. Inuwa Abdul-Kadir, said: “There are over 200 million people in this country. Some of our neighbouring countries depend on us, so our laboratories, need expansion, our equipments need to be upgraded, and the council has realised that the agency is deeply understaffed,” he added. He said the agency also requires supports in terms of vehicles, adding that without this, its staff would be handicapped in meeting their duties, especially those in the field. “We have also realised that the level of drug abuse has increased in the country. Everyone must be involved in addressing this growing menace. NAFDAC will continue to enlighten Nigerians on the risks involved in it.” On her part, the DG, NAFDAC, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, said she was excited when the federal government inaugurated the council, adding that for several years, the agency suffered because there was no board to guide and provide advises. She said: “Funding is one area we must look into, because our work is enormous. The issue if vehicles is extremely important. Without it we cannot do our work properly. “As I speak now, NAFDAC needs about 1,000 computers for its staff, otherwise we will continue to have security risk in terms of data protection.” She called on the federal government to allow the Aagency in ports and borders, adding that this would help the agency address issues of tramadol squarely.
