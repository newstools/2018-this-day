An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court on Friday ordered the remand of 58-year-old man, Franklin Adeyanju, in Kirikiri Prisons for allegedly defiling his neighbour’s five-year-old daughter. Chief Magistrate, Taiwo Akanni, did not take the accused plea, but ordered his remand and adjourned the case until April 30, for mention. The accused, a politician, who resides at 24, Tijani Street, Dopemu, a suburb of Lagos, is being tried for defilement. Earlier, the prosecutor, Clifford Ogu, had told the court that the offence was committed on February 28, at the accused residence. Ogu said the accused resides in the same compound with the girl’s parents. He said: “The accused called the girl, a five-year-old, to his apartment and was fingering her private part when another neighbour, who heard the screaming of the girl, entered the apartment.” “The accused was caught in the act and the woman, who saw him, shouted in order to attract the attention of other neighbours.” Ogu said the accused was brought to the police station, while the offence violated Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos, 2015.
