Mary Ekah As part of activities marking the International Women Day, Wandel International, the flagship company of the Simba Group, sole distributors of the TVS Motors India Limited for motorcycles and tricycles, on Thursday held a one-day free check-up camp for women tricycle riders in Lagos. Being the leading player in the tricycles industry in Nigeria, Simba is through this avenue trying to empower women by encouraging them to be gainfully engaged by riding the TVS tricycles (Keke Marwa) as source of income. Consequently, over 50 women had their TVS tricycles diagnosed and repaired for free of charge at the company premises in Ogba, Lagos where the exercise was carried out. In addition to that, the women were also given free oil filters, engine oil and free pink tarpaulin as well as a short training on safe driving and tips on how to keep their tricycles save and sound. While assuring the business community in Nigeria that the company will continue to encourage women to embrace tricycle riding as a means to curtail the increasing rate of unemployment among the women folk and boost wealth creation, Mr. Manish Rohtagi of Simba Group, stressed that exercise was a milestone on what the company does for the community as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). To ensure the tremendous success of the TVS Tricycle business in Nigeria, Rohtagi noted that over the years, the company has launched many empowerment programmes both for men and women, adding, “To date, we have trained more than 5,000 mechanics Pan Nigeria, distributed 3,000 special tool-sets, which resulted in thousands of job creation”. “At the heart of our value proposition is a commitment to quality and service. The tremendous success of the vehicles in Nigeria is indeed a testament to that”, he added.
