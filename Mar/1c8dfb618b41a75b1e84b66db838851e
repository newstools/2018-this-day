By Rebecca Ejifoma The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) last night, received another 149 Nigerians who voluntarily returned home from Libya. The returnees, who were received on arrival by the South West Zonal Coordinator of NEMA, Mr. Yakubu Suleiman, comprised of 107 male adults, 37 female adults including a medical case, four female children and one female infant. They were brought by Buraq airline chartered flight with registration number 5A-DMGl that landed at 10:45 pm at the NAHCO terminal of the Murtala Muhammad International Airport. The Coordinator admonished the returnees to shun the urge of seeking greener pasture where it did not exist. He, however, pointed out that all nations in the world were facing various challenges. “And as a result of global economic meltdown and that due to ingenuity of the present Federal Government that has overcome the recession while most countries that Nigerians are craving to run to are still grappling with the same economic and social issues worse than that of Nigeria.” He assured them that Nigeria had more than enough resources that can cater for “Our needs but it is left for every one of us to tap from any these abundant resources. “The governments at Federal and State levels have lots of incentives for the returnees for their rehabilitations and reintegration to compliment European Union and IOM.” Programme Manager of IOM Lagos, Mr. Abraham Tamrat, handed over the returnees to NEMA. The returnees, who were brought into the country by officials of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), were given handsets loaded with airtime courtesy of the Offices of the Senior Special Assistant on SDG and Diaspora/Foreign Affairs.
