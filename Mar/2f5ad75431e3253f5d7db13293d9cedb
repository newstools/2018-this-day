A consultant pediatrician at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Dr. Immaculata Tunde-Oremodu, yesterday said Nigeria had the highest number of malaria cases all over the world. Tunde-Oremodu who spoke at a one-day sensitisation and capacity building workshop for media practitioners on key malaria messages, in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, also stated that most common cases of out-patient attendances in the country were due to malaria infections. She said Africa bore over 90 percent of the global burden of malaria with Nigeria accounting for over 29 per cent of the total African burden, the highest prevalence rate of malaria in the world.  The pediatrician noted that though the Federal and state government had intensified efforts to have a malaria-free Nigeria by the year 2020, ignorance remains a major hurdle.  According to her, poor compliance, population, inadequate resources, the deteriorating health system and level of malaria immunity are some other factors militating against the fight against the scourge.
