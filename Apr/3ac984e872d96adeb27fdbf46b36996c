Mohammed Aminu in Gusau Following spate of crimes involving the Fulani herders across the country, the Emir of Anka in Zamfara State, Alhaji Attahiru Ahmad, has called on Fulani leaders in the state, to call their people to order. Ahmad made the call at the weekend in Anka town, while addressing journalists in his palace over last Tuesday and Wednesday’s killings at Bawan Daji Village in his emirate. The monarch described as worrisome the incessant attacks by the herdsmen in some parts of the country. At least 63 persons were reportedly killed by bandits in two separate attacks last Wednesday at Bawan Daji village of Anka local government area of the state. Most residents of the village had already deserted the area as a result of fear that the bandits might attack again. According to him, such attacks should be a source of worry to the Fulani leaders and as such they should call to order those behind the dastardly acts. According to him, “It is disturbing to hear that most of the criminal attacks taking place in almost all parts of the country, involve the Fulani or they are always mentioned.” “This should worry the Fulani leaders and that it is expected that by now, they should call on their people to find out what they really want. This meeting should be called immediately because it is a matter of urgency that should be addressed before it is too late,” he said. He noted that even though the recent attack in the area had nothing to do with Fulani/farmers feud, most of the attackers were said to be of the Fulani extraction.
