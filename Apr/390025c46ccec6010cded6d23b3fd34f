Shola Oyeyipo Former Managing Director, United African Company (UAC), Mr. Chidi Okoro, has vowed to manage the affairs of Imo State with well-researched alternative realities that will facilitate speedy developments f elected governor. Speaking on his agenda for the state during a chat with THISDAY at the weekend, Okoro, who is pursuing his governorship ambition on All Progressives Grand Alliance platform, said he has been working with over 8,000 Imo indigenes in the Imo Arise Network since 2013 to research into areas of opportunities that will eradicate poverty. Okoro, a Spain’s IE Business School graduate and former Managing Director, Glaxo Smith Kline Nigeria between May 2007 and March 2014, is optimistic that the people of the state are prepared for the kind of leadership he plans to implement in Imo State. “In 2013, I wrote a book: ‘Another Perspective’ and since I wrote that book I started work with a couple of people; Imo Arise Network. We built that group. Over time we did major researches on Imo State. We checked on different sectors.” We looked at the opportunities and challenges and we have been working together. “This group is made up of over 3000 members directly and another 5,000 people indirectly. Over time, we have built an alternative reality for Imo State. And as the political space is opening up members of the group think it is time for us to get directly involved and some of them have approached me to get involved so that we can play out that alternative reality that lift Imo State up. “I think the Imo people want to see competence and character. They want to see their lives get better. That will be what will urge me. Imo presents fantastic opportunities. At the moment we are not harnessing the opportunities. We are thinking of how we can unlock the opportunities to make life better for our people,” he said.
