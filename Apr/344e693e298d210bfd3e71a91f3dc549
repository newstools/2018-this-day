Mrs. Tonyi Adeniji, the Executive Director, Micro Enterprises, Bank of Industry and Lead Coordinator of GEEP, disclosed this in an interview with journalists Thursday in Onitsha, Anambra. Adeniji spoke on the sideline of a two-day National Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) Clinic. She said over 4, 000 persons in Anambra had benefitted from the total credit facility of N100 billion earmarked for the programme by the Federal Government across the country. “GEEP micro credit is one of the flagships of the Federal Government’s social intervention programmes that enable entreprenuers have access to affordable credits to fund businesses especially in rural areas. “Beneficiaries access between N50,000 and N100,000 on second grant financing loan which are payable over six months with zero interest. “There is a five per cent admin charge.
