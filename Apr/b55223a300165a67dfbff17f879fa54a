 Evans Wins First Gold for Wales Wales claimed their first gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in Australia thanks to weightlifter Gareth Evans. Evans, who represented Team GB at London 2012, posted a total of 299kg across the snatch and clean and jerk disciplines to win the -69kg category. The 31-year-old’s total was 2kg better than the total put up by Sri Lanka’s Dissanayake Mudiyanselage with Deepak Lather claiming bronze for India. England secured a seventh Gold Coast gold medal when Sarah Vasey continued the team’s fine start to the swimming competition with victory in the women’s 50m breaststroke. Vasey was some way off the pace set by Jamaica’s Alia Atkinson in the early metres but produced a powerful finish to touch just in front of her chief medal rival. Team-mate Alice Tai made it five golds for England in the pool so far with a dominant display in the final of the women’s S9 100m backstroke, winning by almost three seconds. Scotland’s Katie Archibald celebrates taking gold in the women’s 3000m track pursuit There was also a second success in the velodrome for Scotland, where Katie Archibald beat Australia’s Rebecca Wiasak in the final of the women’s 3000m individual pursuit. Archibald finished one-and-a-half seconds ahead of Wiasak to add to the gold medal won on Thursday by Neil Fachie and pilot Matt Rotherham in the blind and visually impaired 1000m time-trial. But there would be no dream family double as Katie’s brother John Archibald was beaten in the final of the men’s 4000m individual pursuit by England’s Charlie Tanfield. Tanfield, who had set a new Commonwealth Games record in qualifying for the final, built a healthy lead in the first half of the race and held on by seven-tenths of a second after Archibald finished strongly. He had also won a silver medal as part of England’s team pursuit squad on Thursday.
