Djossou “Agoy” Basile, the Beninois opponent of Rilwan “Baby Face” Babatunde for the West African Boxing Union (WABU) welterweight title bout scheduled for GOtv Boxing Night 14, has vowed to reduce the Nigerian to pulp. The fight, along with six others, will hold at the Indoor Sports Hall of the National Stadium in Lagos, on 14 April. Basile, whose fightinh record is impressive, said he is aware that Baby Face is unbeaten, a record he is coming to end. “I will crush him like paper waste. I know he has not been defeated, but that is because he has been fighting his mates. I am not his mate. In terms of boxing, I am his father. A father can whip his son whenever the son is naughty,” Basile said through an interpreter at the weekend. Similarly, scheduled to be in action at the event is Nigeria’s Waidi “Skoro” Usman, who is scheduled to take on Kenya’s Michael “Shaka” Nyawade for the African Boxing Union featherweight title. In yet another title fight, Rilwan “Real One” Oladosu will attempt to win the national lightweight title when he takes on Kazeem “Ijoba” Badmus. Also in the lightweight category, ABU champion, Oto “Joe Boy” Joseph will face Prince “Lion” Nwoye in a challenge bout. In the cruiserweight division, Ramon “Hyena” Razak will clash with Abiodun “Finito” Afini, while Chukwuebuka “Wise King” Ezewudo will fight Semiu ” Jagaban” Olapade in the super middleweight category. The event will also see Majesty Maduka up against Sulaimon Adeosun.
