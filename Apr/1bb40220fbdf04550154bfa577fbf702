Mohammed Aminu in Sokoto The Sokoto State Governor, Alhaji Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, has urged Nigerians to use the Easter period to stand up for all those who have found themselves in vulnerable situations in the country and other parts of the world. This was contained in a message to commemorate this year’s Easter period issued in Sokoto on Sunday by his spokesman, Malam Imam Imam. The governor said all members of the society should make sacrifices that would advance the cause of the vulnerable and the downtrodden. “Easter is a period of divine. We should spread that love around by praying, and standing up to victims of circumstance that have found themselves in vulnerable situations within us and elsewhere. “We can do this by working closely with charity organisations to give them hope, courage and the will to be strong. Doing this will make Nigeria and the world a better place to live in,” the statement read. Tambuwal to this end, congratulated Nigerians, especially those of Christian faith for the Easter celebration. He restated the commitment of his administration to implementing policies and programmes that would positively impact on the lives of the people.
