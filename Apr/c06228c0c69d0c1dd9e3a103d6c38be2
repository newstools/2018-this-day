Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba Former Delta State governor, Dr Emmauel Uduaghan, has endorsed the re-election bid of the incumbent Governor of the state, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa. Uduaghan, who made the assertion yesterday at a grand reception in honour of the member representing the Aniocha/Oshimili constituency in the Federal House of Representatives, Hon. Joan Mrakpor in Delta, disclosed that insinuations about his disapproval of Okowa for the 2019 governorship election were baseless. Te former governor stated that any discussion about another person, other than Okowa in 2019, was unnecessary because Okowa has performed execellently well and he also enjoys the overwhelming support of Delta citizens and particularly the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He, therefore, urged the people, especially political office holders, to rally round the governor and support him to achieve success in the execution of his development programmes for Delta State. Uduaghan asserted that “Okowa will be the Governor of Delta State again from 2015 to 2023.” He also called on Okowa to dismiss rumours that some key stakeholders in the state will not support his second term bid. “Our Governor, don’t listen to the stories you hear. You know the way people talk, don’t worry. No shaking! We are here for you. Delta is a PDP state and will remain a PDP state.”
