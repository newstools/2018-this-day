The Secretary to Ebonyi State Government, Professor Benard Odoh, has resigned his appointment, THISDAY authoritatively gathered. THISDAY gathered that the former state scribe literally said he took the decision so as to protect his relationship with the governor, David Umahi, stressing that he has more to preserve than occupy the position of the SSG. Odoh said  the way by which Umahi’s administration had remained in the past two years has not offered conducive atmosphere for all members of the state executive council members and himself to sincerely air and express their views on sensitive policy matters. He said: “In my opinion, this is the highest level of hypocrisy and the values I live does not allow me to operate in such deceptive atmosphere where people live opposite of what/who they are.” “Having assured you on my inception of office and at several times that I owe you the responsibility to be truthful and honest always, I wish to inform you that all is not well in your administration sir. If you observe carefully, almost all your appointees are nearly completely disconnected from your policy direction as they lack genuine sense of purpose, dignity, clear sense of commitment to decision taken in Council because of low morale. “Once more on behalf of my family, friends and those who worked closely with me for almost three years now, I want to most sincerely again say thank you very much for the rare opportunity you offered me to serve our dear state”. ‘”my appointment as the Secretary to the State government is hereby resigned in good faith. I have handed over the status of cabinet office to the most senior staff office, Ogbonnaya Otta, in line with the best practices of service.”
The former governor further commended the wife of the state governor, Rachel and the entire Umahi’s dynasty for the opportunity and love to serve the state government.
