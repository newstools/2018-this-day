It is not all prophets that are without honour in their hometown. Some not only do, the honour comes from the highest quarters. That is the lot of the former Governor of Delta State, Chief James Ibori. Since he returned home from the UK, he has been very, very visible on the social scene. Just at the weekend, the almighty “Ogidigbogboigbo” (which loosely translates to mean the all knowing, all powerful achiever, whose words means so much. What he says he would do or does) (a sort of demi-god/deity), was installed as the “Izonfini-Owei of Ijawland”, which also loosely translates to mean “The one that always speaks the truth.” This honour was bestowed on him by the Pere of Akugbene-Mein Kingdom in Delta State, HRM, Stanley P. Luke, Kalanama VIII. According to the monarch, Ibori, was so recognised for his exemplary leadership qualities. Hear the Pere- the people of the area held the reception to honour Ibori in appreciation of the developmental strides he brought to Akugbene, the Ijaw nation and the entire Delta State during his 1999 to 2007 governorship tenures. He went further to say, “The people of Akugbene reminded Ibori that until he built the 612 metres long Bomadi Bridge over River Forcados, at the cost $50 Million (USD), cars had no access to the Bomadi LGA and its other 11 communities. The Bridge made possible the first road connection between the Ijaw mainland and the riverine areas. As usual, his beautiful, proportionately shaped woman, Senami, was beside him. Senami Sosu-Ibori, a University of Lagos graduate, was catapulted from sheer obscurity to prosperity and relative popularity when it became obvious that Ibori’s pulse had become her private ticker tape. Even when she had to go under during the former governor’s trial and subsequent incarceration, the couple remained in touch. Since his release, he has not shied away from showing her off. At the event, they were a sight for sore eyes as their PDA was nonpareil. Looking regal and royal.
