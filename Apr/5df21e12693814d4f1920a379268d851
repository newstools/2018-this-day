Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo enjoys going on funny errands, sometimes without prodding. Wanting to be seen as fast learning the ropes, he has committed many gaffes that should not be associated with his office and status. That an important player in the presidency would resort to referencing sources in the discharge of its assignment is the new low being savoured by the Muhammadu Buhari administration. Days back, he accused former President Goodluck Jonathan and his cronies of sharing N150 billion two weeks to the 2015 elections (without proof) and in yet another instance, said over $3 billion was looted under the Jonathan administration through strategic alliance contracts, which according to him could have been used to construct seven major roads (still without proof). It is not enough to continue to make such weighty and unsubstantiated allegations all in the name of wanting to look good before an already peeved public; it is sickening that three years after assuming office and handed the mandate to deliver change, this government still indulges in blame game. Sadly, found somewhat appropriate to always deliver this “mid-night errand” has always been Osinbajo. He appears the ‘Manchurian Candidate’ of the Buhari presidency. This is certainly not good for him!
