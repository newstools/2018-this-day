The arrival of Table Tennis whizkid, Aruna Quadri has boosted the morale of his teammates as well as other Nigerian officials as the semi final of Team Event strokes off. In the absence of Quadri, Segun Toriola piloted the team to berth in the semi finals which automatically guarantees a medal in the ongoing Commonwealth Games  in Gold Coast, Australia. Toriola was overwhelmed yesterday when he said at the Games Village that they’ve been fortified by the arrival of Quadri. ‘’We’re set to go in our events with the arrival of Quardri. His presence alone will ginger us not to talk of when he joins forces with us to play’’, Toriola said. Also speaking yesterday, Coach Bello Nosiru said that Nigeria was at a touching distance for a medal and were buoyed with the arrival of Aruna Quardri. ‘’We played so well without Quardri but now that he is around, we won’t look back for our quest for gold in the Team event and the singles’’, Bello said. Quadri is the highest ranking player competing at GC2018 and Nosiru is confident the 29-year-old will cope with the pressure at the event to make a podium finish. Quadri will be joined by Nigerian teammates Bode Abiodun and Segun Toriola, Azeez Jamiu and Olajide Omotayo in the search for Commonwealth Games men’s table tennis medals.
