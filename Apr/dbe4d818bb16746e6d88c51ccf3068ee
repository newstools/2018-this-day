Mohammed Aminu in Sokoto
The Sokoto State Government on Tuesday said it had increased access to immunisation by more than a thousand fold, from a meager 2.5 per cent in 2014 to 25 per cent in 2018. A statement issued by government’s spokesman, Malam Imam Imam, in Sokoto, said Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal disclosed this during a review meeting on the progress of routine immunisation in the state. According to the statement, the recent Lot Quality Assurance Survey (LQAS) by the National Bureau of Statistics and partners have clearly outlined the progress made in that direction.
The statement said within this period under review, Sokoto has come tops on issues of vaccine security, vaccine availability, vaccine quality and vaccine accountability. “Two years ago, we had 205 centres offering routine immunisation in the state. Today, the number is 567. Our target is to have as many of these centres across the state as possible.
“We want to ensure that all communities in Sokoto, no matter how small or remote, have access to functional health facilities that will offer routine immunisation to our children. “We have also enhanced our advocacy by involving religious and traditional leaders and this has led to tremendous progress.
“We thank our partners, especially Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Dangote Foundation, UNICEF, USAID and many others for their dedication and commitment to ensuring all our children are immunised against preventable diseases,” the statement read. Tambuwal further said the government would expand its social intervention programs with a view to empowering the people to fight poverty, illiteracy and diseases.
“We believe that tackling poverty and enhancing access to education would play important roles in improving the overall living condition of the people, especially those in rural areas,” Tambuwal added.
