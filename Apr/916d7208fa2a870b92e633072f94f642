Yekini Jimoh in Lokoja
Kabiru Seidu (aka Osama) and Nuhu Salisu (aka Small) who alleged that Senator Dino Melaye gave them arms were yesterday re-arrested by the police. Seidu and Salisu who escaped from police custody in Lokoja alongside four other suspected criminals were re-arrested in different locations.
The two suspect had earlier alleged that Melaye representing Kogi West senatorial district in the National Assembly gave them guns and some money to disrupt the 2019 general election. Their escape was allegedly planned and coordinated with the aid of some police officers at the Special Anti-Robbery Squad in Lokoja, according to the former Kogi State Commissioner of Police,  Ali Janga. THISDAY yesterday reliably gathered that while Seidu was re-arrested in Bauchi State last Sunday, his partner,  Salisu, was rearrested at Odu in Dekina Local Government area of the state.
The six suspects: Seidu, Salisu Aliyu Isa, Adams Suleiman, Emmanuel Audu and Musa Mohammed escaped from ‘A’ Division of Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) detention in Lokoja, Kogi State capital, where they were being held pending their arraignment in court with Melaye who had also been declared wanted by the police. The escaped of the six criminals led to the removal of the state Commissioner of Police,  Janga and was replaced by Sunday Ogbu who took over last week Friday.
Thirteen other police officers were redeployed from the state and moved to Abuja for further interrogation.
Meanwhile,  the Police Public Relations of Kogi State Police Command,  Mr. William Ayah, in phone chat with THISDAY yesterday, confirmed the re-arrest of the six suspected criminals.
