Net impairment loss on financial assets also reduced from N35.522 billion to N22.667 billion.

Loans and advances stood at N649.8billion. In a statement, FCMB Group said: “In spite of the reduction in the headline numbers, the group’s performance for the year 2017 witnessed an improvement in core operating performance over the previous year after adjusting for the significant foreign exchange revaluation income enjoyed in 2016. In line with the repositioning strategy of the group for better performance, the key drivers of the performance include increase in income from our non-banking activities, lower impairment charges from the bank and its subsidiaries, and improved operating efficiencies through more pervasive use of technology’’. The financial institution assured stakeholders that that, ‘’barring any unforeseen circumstances, we see improved operating performance in 2018 based on the improving macro-economic and capital markets environment, declining cost of funds for the bank, and the growing contributions of asset and wealth management following last year’s acquisitions.’’ In November 2017, FCMB completed the acquisition of an additional 60 per cent stake in Legacy Pension Managers Limited, which increased FCMB’s stake from 28.2 per cent to 88.2 per cent , thereby making Legacy a subsidiary of FCMB. According to FCMB, the acquisition has helped achieve further diversification of service offerings and, consequently, earnings within the FCMB Group, which will be felt from the 2018 financial year.
