Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti As part of its efforts to boost quality healthcare for the citizenry, Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD) in partnership with Atlanta Georgia USA-based Bridge of Life (BOL), want to establish Haemodialysis Centre in the 400-bed Afe Babalola University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH). The multi system hospital, which was commissioned on October 20, last year commenced operations on March 21, 2018. The centre would focus on four critical areas of kidney care, primary care and prevention and education as well as kids’ camps, thus bringing care of the kidney closer to the people. Speaking at a one-day train-the-trainers workshop on the ABUAD/BOL Haemodialysis Partnership in Ado-Ekiti on Saturday, BOL’s Director of Technical Operations, Mr. Christopher Atwater, recalled how impressed he was after his August 2017 on-site needs assessment at ABUAD teaching hospital, which he said motivated BOL to support the Haemodialysis Unit. Atwater said: “I have been here before. What I saw about this hospital amazed me and fired my interest. Because of this interest in him and his modern university, I made up my mind to be part of this project. This is why I am here and I am happy to be here.” According to him, “the principal objective of the BOL Haemodialysis partnership all over the world is to empower people to set up their own Haemodialysis Centres that will be internationally acclaimed and recognised. “We are not here for a mere partnership. We are here to supply and install world-class Haemodialysis equipment, test-run them, train people on how to use the sophisticated equipment for enhanced performance. We are here to offer a total package by providing quality and sustainable patient care and the tools to manage clinical operations through comprehensive training.”
