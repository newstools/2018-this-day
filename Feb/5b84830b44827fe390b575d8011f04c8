The campaign to tackle the challenge of malnutrition in Delta State has intensified with the launch on Friday (yesterday) of Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement in Asaba, the state capital. The launching, which was organised by Delta State Government in collaboration with UNICEF-Nigeria, also witnessed the investiture of the wife of the Delta State Governor, Dame Edith Okowa, as Nutrition Champion for Delta State.  The investiture which makes Dame Okowa a UNICEF Nutrition Ambassador, is in recognition of the Delta State First Lady’s outstanding contribution to the welfare and development of women and children through her various programmes like her pet project, the  “05 Initiative”.  Speaking during the investiture ceremony at the Government House Asaba, Dame Okowa stressed the need for all hands to be on deck in the efforts to tackle malnutrition through the SUN campaign, saying that the contributions of individuals starting from the family level would go a long way in complementing the effort of government.  She noted that ignorance was a major bane of malnutrition problem other than lack of money for proper feeding habit, stressing that the breastfeeding is invaluable to infant and young child nutrition but is often neglected for breast milk substitutes.
