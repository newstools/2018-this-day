The Trump administration leveled the strongest economic sanctions yet against the North Korean regime today. The Treasury Department hit more than 50 vessels, shipping companies and trade businesses with sanctions. The actions are the administration’s latest effort to put maximum pressure on North Korea to end its illegal nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs. “We imposed today the heaviest sanctions ever imposed on a country,” President Trump said February 23. The sanctions follow through on Vice President Pence’s promise during his February visit to Japan that the administration would increase pressure on North Korea to verifiably dismantle its nuclear program. The new sanctions target one individual, 27 entities, and 28 vessels located, registered or flagged in North Korea, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Marshall Islands, Tanzania, Panama and Comoros. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, in announcing the sanctions, “The president has made it clear to companies worldwide that if they choose to help fund North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, they will not do business with the United States.”
