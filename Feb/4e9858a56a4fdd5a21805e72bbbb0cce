Ibrahim Shuaibu in Dutse The Kano/Jigawa operations of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has sealed off three filling stations in Jigawa State for selling petrol above the official pump price of N145, hoarding and outright diversion of the product. The downstream regulatory agency also ensured the instant sale of thousands of litres of fuel to the public at the official price, especially filling stations suspected to be selling above N145 per litre but usually revert to the official price on citing the DPR surveillance team or based on a tip-off from their informants. The DPR team leader, Kano/Jigawa operations, Paul Jehzi, told reporters weekend that at Garba Mohammed Investment Oil Company Ltd in Shuwarin area of the state, the station was found to have diverted 130,000 litres of fuel which warranted the outright sealing of the premises. “We had discovered that this station had diverted two trucks of particularly petroleum products of 40,000 litres each. On coming again, we discovered that another 50,000 litres given to the company just yesterday has not been discharged. As it is, 130 litres have not been delivered, that means it has been diverted. That is why we had to seal the station and fine them appropriately,” he said. He said that Jahun Petroleum Nigeria Ltd was also found to be selling at N180 per litre with a stock of over 25,900 litres and was automatically closed down. He added that Tazara Petroleum Ltd around Jahun roundabout was also found to have a stock of 11,300 litres but was not selling at all and as such, it was promptly sealed off. According to Jehzi, “At the NNPC filling station, Olusegun Obasanjo Way Dutse, the state capital, the team had to order the sale of 2,000 out of the 3,000 litres reserve of PMS to the public. The fuel was said to have been reserved for government officials.” Details later…
