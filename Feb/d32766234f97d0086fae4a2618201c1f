Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti The Ekiti State chapter of the pan-Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, has appealed to the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu and the National Chairman of the party, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun to settle their differences in the interest of the party. The group praised President Muhammadu Buhari for deeming it fit to appoint Tinubu as the Chairman of Reconciliation Committee to settle all the crises within the party towards making the party stronger in preparation for 2019 and beyond.
The organisation also commended Tinubu for taking up the assignment which every discerning mind knows how herculean it is. Also, Ekiti Afenifere praised the Oyegun-led party executive for being realistic about the state of the party and exhibited readiness to cooperate with the committee to bring peace to APC.
In a statement by the Chairman, Elder Yemi Alade, the group urged Oyegun not to regard the Tinubu committee as an indictment of the party leadership as lacking the capacity to deliver but as part of measures to build confidence in the rank and file of its membership. Ekiti Afenifere described as timely the presidential warning that no one should attempt to impose any candidate on the party at any level. This the Afenifere is in complete agreement.
On the issue of security, the organization is of the opinion that all security agents should not relax at any time as the insurgents are never asleep. Accordingly, the army should brace up and never to allow such mindless account of students kidnap to rear its ugly head again. What we need is peace across the nation and we know government can make it happen.
