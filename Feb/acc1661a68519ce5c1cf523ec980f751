WORLD CUP 2018 BUILDUP Femi Solaja with agency report
The duo of Joel Obi and Brown Ideye may have gradually warmed themselves back into Super Eagles’ setup following the invitation coach Gernot Rohr extended to them ahead of the international friendlies the team will play next month in the build up to the World Cup finals in June. Although the technical crew is yet to release the team list of players invited for the build up matches against Poland and Serbia, Owngoalnigeria.com scooped on the official letter sent to Joel Obi’s Serie A side, Torino FC last week requesting for the release of the former Flying Eagles midfielder. According to the website, the Italian Serie A side Torino confirmed the invitation of Obi who has been one of their top players this season by the coach of the Nigerian team. “Torino confirmed his invitation via a statement on their official website. So far the Nigerian has made 15 Serie A appearances with four goals to his name despite playing as a defensive midfielder,” the report said. The 26 year-old Obi is staging a return to the national team set up after a four-year absence. No thanks to injuries and fitness issues. He last represented Nigeria in a pre World Cup friendly game against Scotland on the 28th of May 2014. Ideye who recently moved to Spanish LaLiga side Malaga has also earned his recall to the team on the strength of his impressive showings for the struggling side since his move to the team in January. The former West Brom striker has played in all of the four games of the team since his arrival with a goal to his name despite the team struggling to remain in the top division in Spain. The match against Poland is scheduled for Wroclaw on Friday, 23rd March while the game with Serbia is for The Hive, London on Tuesday, 27th March 2018.
