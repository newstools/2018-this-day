The presidency has announced the cancellation of Wednesday’s weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) in the State House, Abuja. A statement by President Muhammadu Buhari’s Special Adviser, Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, said the meeting was cancelled because the president would be participating in an international conference on Lake Chad Basin in Abuja for the better part of the day. The statement read: “The meeting of the FEC will not hold on Wednesday, February 28, 2018.
“This is due to the participation of President Buhari and a significant number of ministers at the high-level meeting of the international conference on Lake Chad Basin, at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, for the better part of that day.”
