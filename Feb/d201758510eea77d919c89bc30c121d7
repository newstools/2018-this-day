Kargar referred to Nigeria’s auto policy as exceptionally inclusive and thorough, one of the traits that inform Nissan’s eagerness to make a greater contribution in the Nigerian market. “We are happy to continue our collaboration with the government to transform Nigeria into a notable manufacturing and distribution hub,” he said.
