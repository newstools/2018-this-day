James Emejo in Abuja The spate of defection in the House of Representatives continued  thursday as the only Labour Party lawmaker, Hon. Segun Ogunwuyi, representing Ogbomosho/North/South/Orire federal constituency of Oyo State defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). According to Ogunwuyi’s letter, which was read on the floor of the House by the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Sulaimon Yusuf Lasun, he left the Labour Party due to its “factionalisation” at the national level. “I wish to notify you and the entire House that I have defected to the APC. This action and decision is as a result of the factionalisation in the Labour Party that sponsored my election into the House of Representatives. “Presently there are two persons laying claim to the position of the national chairman of the party will its attendant factional national executive committee. He said: “After wide consultations with my constituents, I have been advised to formally defect to the APC so that were can together actualize our vision of moving our constituency, Oyo state and Nigeria at large.” The lawmaker submitted that “this action is in tandem with the provisions of section 68 (1) (g) of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended)”. His defection, brings the nominal roll of APC members in the lower chamber to 230 members while the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has 122 members.
