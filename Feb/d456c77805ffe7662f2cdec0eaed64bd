Without a doubt, Oba Adedapo Tejuoso, the Osile of Oke Ona, Abeokuta, Ogun State, is one of the foremost traditional rulers in the country.
As proof of his pre-eminence, encomiums were poured on him from several quarters when he clocked 80 last Monday. In particular, President Muhammadu Buhari; Senate President, Bukola Saraki; Afenifere chieftain, Chief Ayo Adebanjo and many eminent Nigerians all extolled the virtues of the born-again Christian traditional ruler at a reception held for him under the expansive marquee at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library Complex, Abeokuta.
He was hailed by PMB for his contributions through his interventions during the constitutional conference 1994.
Also, one of his children, Senator Lanre Tejuoso, said his father had been a good example to the children. Ayo Olusanya, spokesperson for the Osile, was on hand to ensure that everything went well for guests during the celebrations.
The event was attended by dignitaries, including Ogun State Deputy Governor, Mrs. Yetunde Onanuga, who represented Gov. Ibikunle Amosun; former President Olusegun Obasanjo; Publisher, Ovation Magazine, Bashorun Dele Momodu; Senators Dino Melaye, Demola Seriki, Rabiu Kwankwaso and Iyalode Alaba Lawson, among others.
