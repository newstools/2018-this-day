Operatives of the Nigeria Police attached to B’Division, Warri, Delta State, have arrested two robbery suspects with a tricycle, a gun and an army polo shirt. The suspects, who were allegedly specialised in snatching tricycles at gunpoint after displaying an army uniform before their victims, were identified as Ogaga Ebulechi from Uwuamughe, Agbarho and Sunny Ajayi. Sources disclosed that the suspects boarded a tricycle last Wednesday from Uwuamughe, headquarters of the Urhobo Progress Union (UPU) and led the rider to a quiet street inside Warri where they snatched the tricycle from its owner after pointing a gun at him and showing him army polo. Ogaga, who’s a professional driver and Ajayi allegedly took the tricycle to Uwuamughe and from there to Ughelli before heading back to Uwuamughe.  Unknown to them, the tricycle had an anti-theft tracker. A source disclosed that police operatives from B’Division got a wind of the stolen tricycle from the manager of Wetland Micro Finance which gave out loan for the purchase of the tricycle.
