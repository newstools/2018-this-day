Peter Uzoho The House of Representatives Committee on Banking and Currency has commended the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for its ongoing intervention project at the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria (ASCON), Topo, Badagry. The project, which is one of the several intervention projects across sectors of the economy undertaken by the CBN to raise capacity, was described as strategic to the nation’s economic development. The project sites visited by the lawmakers included a three blocks of two and three-storey hostel buildings and an adjourning 500-seater auditorium at the ASCON. The Chairman of the committee, Hon. Jones Onyerere, said the committee was highly impressed by the outcome of the work being done at the project site, saying what they saw surpassed their expectation. “We didn’t think that we would get this kind of outcome judging from our first impression,” Onyerere said. “By looking at the project as it is, I think it’s so far so good,” he added. According to him, the central bank has created a conducive learning environment for participants in the institution which he said was lacking before the CBN’s intervention. “There is no doubt that the three bedroom flat for the staff, hostel accommodation and restaurant for the participants and a very good auditorium will create room for learning process”. He also commended CBN for making use of local contractors, stressing that such act indicates that Nigeria is beginning to patronise local contractors.
