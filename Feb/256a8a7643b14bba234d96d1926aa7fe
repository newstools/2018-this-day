Abbah who disclosed this last week in Lagos at the 2018 Inter-House Sports Competition of Nigeria Navy Secondary School, Navy Town, Ojo, said the organisation of more sports competitions in Secondary Schools would help to promote the spirit of healthy competition and sportsmanship amongst students. He urged those that excelled during the competition to use it as a platform to go higher, noting that those of them that would not perform as they expect themselves to should it as a platform for learning and see how they can improve, “this particular occasion is a breeding ground for the country.” Abbah who was represented at the event by the Commodore, Dickson Olisemenoghor, said there were a lot of innovations and creativity shown by the students, stating that this would not have been possible without the efforts of the Commandant of the School. “I am not surprised that they have attained this feat and the Chief of Navy Staff has provided us with the necessary infrastructure that we need to get to this level,” he noted. In her remarks, the Commandant of the School, Jobi Stevens, said the competition has provided the platform for four houses to compete blue (Wey), green (Sorch), red (Aduwo) and the purple (Adelanwa) for medals. She explained that there is a lot of improvement and energy invested in training and preparing the students for the competition, adding that they are committed in maintaining the standard of competition. Stevens expressed satisfaction with the performance of the students in the competition, while noting that there is room for improvement, “I am satisfied with their performance, but that does not mean that there is no room for improvement. I see talents in these kids and I hope they build on what they have learnt here.”
