Chairman of Enyimba FC, Chief Felix Anyansi-Agwu, has described late Chinedu Udoji, former captain of the Aba team as ‘special’, while enjoining the current playing staff of the club to aspire to his legacy. Anyansi-Agwu yesterday held a meeting with the Peoples’ Elephant, and was visibly emotional as he reminisced on Udoji’s early days at the club. The address began with a minute’s silence observed in honour of the deceased Kano Pillars player, after which Anyansi charged the players to lead similarly exemplary lives. “Chinedu (Udoji) is someone I’m very proud of. Seeing the reaction of Nigeria (over his death), you begin to understand what it means for someone to be special. “His attitude to the team showed gratitude and love, right to the end. He is an example, and a lesson to you all: Use this career well, and it will lift you. Anybody can die, but your aim should be to be remembered the way Chinedu is remembered today. He left an impact on the hearts and minds of everyone,” recalled the NFF board member.
Anyansi also expressed his sadness at the plight of the late defender’s young widow and children. To that end, he pledged the total support and commitment of the management of Enyimba to assuaging their loss. “As long as I remain the Chairman, Enyimba will play a big role for his family. A very big role,” he vowed.
Afterward, he challenged the players concerning the club’s Round of 32 clash against Energie FC in the CAF Confederation Cup next month. Anyansi warned against any form of complacency going into the tie, and iterated his belief in the team’s ability to compete on multiple fronts. “Please do not underrate the team we are going to play. They are well motivated. They are a young team, and highly physical. “If we play ourselves out of the continent, there won’t be the moral to continue in the league. When we won the CAF Champions League back-to-back, we won the league as well. You must understand that, and be challenged by it,” he concluded.
