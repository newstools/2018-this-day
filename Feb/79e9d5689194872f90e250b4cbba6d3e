Chief Famous Daunemugha, one of the passengers in the Dana Airline, which overshot the runway at an airport in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has collapsed while receiving sympathisers in his house in Bayelsa. The politician was said to have been shaken by the near crash of the commercial airplane and currently receiving treatment in a hospital in Yenagoa. Daunemougha, a Niger Delta Activist, former governorship aspirant of the defunct Congress for progressive change (CPC) in 2011 and chieftain of the All progressives congress (APC)  in Bayelsa, collapsed after arriving home at about 7,30pm, a witness said yesterday. A close family source, Ebiowei Daunemugha , who confirmed the incident to journalists, said his brother  collapsed while receiving visitors who came to felicitate with him over the near incident. At the Bay bridge home of the politician last night, crowds of family members and loyalists of the APC chieftain were seen offering prayers for his quick recovery. A friend of Daunemigha ,who claimed to have missed the Dana flight in Abuja, said that most of the traumatised passengers, who attempted to demand for explanations from the airliner, were not attended to.
