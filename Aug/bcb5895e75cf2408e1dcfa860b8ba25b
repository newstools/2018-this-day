The  All Progressives Congress (APC) has described the challenge posed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), for a national  debate on good governance as  incredible and laughable. PDP had challenged the ruling party and President Muhammadu Buhari to a public debate on good governance ahead of the 2019 elections.
However, in a statement issued by the acting National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabene, APC said a party that supervised several atrocities too numerous to mention, cannot be in a position to debate on good governance. “We view this request by the PDP as another laughable example of the PDP’s selective amnesia on the 16 years of locust it wrecked on Nigeria during its defunct rule,” APC said. The ruling party added that the PDP needs to be reminded of the reason why Nigerians voted it out unanimously in 2015 to give way to a progressive administration, which is rebuilding the country in all facets from the foundation. APC said the PDP is synonymous with impunity, institutionalised corruption, adding that the main opposition party has been accused of “diversion of counter-insurgency votes to political cronies and funding of political activities, illegal purchase of bullet-proof SUVs, limousines and private jet shindigs for ministers at public expense; non-remittance of $20 billion oil revenue; among other atrocities too numerous to mention, cannot be in a position to debate on good governance”
“A party whose administration placed the economy on life support through its voodoo economics and fiscal recklessness cannot be in a position to debate on good governance. The PDP in its desperation to position itself as the 2019 general election approaches cannot hoodwink Nigerians on who they truly are,’ it said.
