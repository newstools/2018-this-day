Deji Elumoye in Abuja Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has expressed concern over the last minute cancellation of the approval granted to Senator Musa Kwankwaso to use the Eagle Square in Abuja for his 2019 presidential declaration. Saraki, in a statement signed by his Media Adviser, Yusuph Olaniyonu, in Abuja on Wednesday, said the “Eagle Square belongs to all Nigerians”. According to him, the cancellation sends a wrong signal about the tolerance level in the nation’s politics. “The refusal to allow Senator Kwankwaso to utilise the Eagle Square for his presidential declaration, despite an earlier approval, sends a wrong message about our democracy, particularly the tolerance level in our politics,” he said. Saraki further emphasised that “Eagle Square belongs to all Nigerians because it was built with public funds”, adding that: “We hope this is not what we will be seeing as we approach the 2019 general election.”
