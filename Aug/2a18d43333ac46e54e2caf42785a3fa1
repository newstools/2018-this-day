Meanwhile, Saraki has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to institute an independent judicial panel of inquiry into last Tuesday’s invasion of the National Assembly by masked gunmen. In a tweet this morning on his personal @bukolasaraki handle, Saraki said, “The very serious questions about last Tuesday’s siege on the National Assembly can only be answered through a thorough and neutral investigation. “I call on Mr. President to immediately institute an independent judicial panel of inquiry to look into that assault on our democracy.” Saraki Must Go, Says Oshiomhole In a related development, the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole, has again urged its members in the Senate to remove Saraki from office. He spoke at a meeting with APC senators and members of the House of Representatives, in Abuja yesterday. Oshiomhole said Saraki’s removal has become imminent because the party and its majority lawmakers would not accept minority rule. Oshiomhole said, “We will impeach (remove) Saraki legally and democratically. The only way he can avoid impeachment (removal) is to either resign or return to the majority party- even then we will not accept him; he should remain where he is. “No amount of blackmail or sponsored analysts can stop his removal.” He also said the threat of a government shutdown was imminent as such there was the need for lawmakers on the APC platform to do everything legally possible to reconvene the National Assembly in order to approve Buhari’s request for the passage of INEC’s 2019 election budget. The meeting was still in progress at press time.
