By Bennett Oghifo The Chief Executive Officer of Visionscape Sanitation Solutions, John Irvine has said that the recent re-emergence of waste in parts of Lagos was caused by the temporary closure of two transfer loading stations in that axis for upgrades and refurbishment of the facilities. According to a statement by Irvine, “We are aware of the recent complaints about the resurgence of waste across the Lagos West axis of the State. Under the new arrangements for waste management reform by the Lagos State Ministry of the Environment, our mandate to accelerate waste infrastructure has made it necessary to temporarily close two transfer loading stations in that axis for upgrades and refurbishment of the facilities. As a result, there is a backlog as Waste Collection Operators experience a higher turn-around time. “This underscores the importance of infrastructure to the waste management system and our role as Visionscape Sanitation Solutions remains the provision of these facilities. “Other environmental works like drainage and waterways management are handled by the Ministry of the Environment and its relevant agencies.
