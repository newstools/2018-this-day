Francis Sardauna in Katsina The Emir of Daura, Dr. Umar Farouk Umar, wednesday conferred a traditional title of Dan-baiwan Hausa (gifted child of Hausa) on the former Governor of Abia State, Dr. Orji Kalu. At the turbaning ceremony in Daura, the monarch said the decision of the Daura emirate council to honour Kalu was necessary considering his track records in the development of Nigeria. According to the emir, the council has approved the conferment of the title in recognition of Kalu’s enormous contributions which he exemplified vis-à-vis stability and oneness of the country. “The rationale behind the title is to encourage Kalu to continue to support President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration in bettering the lives of Nigerian,” Umar said. Responding, Kalu, who was visibly overwhelmed by the gesture, said the honour would encourage him to sustain his humanitarian assistance to the masses. He added that the emir has demonstrated his passion and commitment to a united and indivisible Nigeria, calling on other traditional rulers to emulate his kind gesture in order to sustain the spirit of oneness. He said: “I am appreciative of the recognition of my contributions to nation building and I pledge my continued loyalty to Daura emirate council, Katsina State and Nigeria at large. “The honour is timely and encouraging. This is a good compensation for continually spreading the message of peace and unity across the nation,” he added. He noted that the conferment would make him intensity efforts, and pray that Buhari returns to power in 2019 to continue his good work. Meanwhile, Kalu, Plateau State Governor, Simon Bako Lalong; Communication Minister, Adebayo Shitu, later met President Buhari at his residence in Daura behind closed-door.
