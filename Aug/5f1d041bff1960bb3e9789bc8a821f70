By Vanessa Obioha with agency reports Walmart Inc announced on Wednesday that it was teaming up with with comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres to launch a women’s fashion line. The line, dubbed EV1, will feature nearly 60 items, ranging from denim, tees bearing Ellen quotes, accessories and footwear, all priced at $30 or less, with new items seasonally. The retailer said that the multi-year fashion partnership with DeGeneres would kick-off on September 10 when the women’s line debuts on Walmart.com and in more than 2,300 stores. In recent times, Walmart, the largest clothing retailer in the United States, has been upgrading the apparel section in its stores with improved displays, open floor plans and better fitting rooms. Last November, it tied up with department store operator Lord & Taylor by offering it dedicated space on Walmart.com. In February, Walmart launched four private label clothing brands to boost sales in the category. The retailer also acquired several small online brands like Shoebuy, Modcloth and Bonobos last year to boost growth in the clothing and accessories business.
