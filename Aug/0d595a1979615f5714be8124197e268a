Femi Ogbonnikan in Abeokuta
The Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, yesterday, made a surprise visit to former President Olusegun Obasanjo in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, and held about 90 minutes’ closed-door meeting with him. Saraki, who adorned a flowing white agbada and a white cap, arrived the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), located along Presidential Boulevard, at about 5.27p.m.
Details of the meeting were not made available to journalists who kept vigil for him at the OOPL to give details of his meeting with the elder statesman. Shortly after his defection to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Senate president visited former military Head of State, General Ibrahim Babangida (rtd) at his Hilltop Mansion in Minna, Niger State last week. However, when he emerged from his closed-door meeting with Obasanjo, Saraki parried questions put to him and also kept mute on national issues or anything pertaining to the ongoing rancour within the Senate leadership, preparatory to the forthcoming 2019 general election but simply said he came to Abeokuta to see Obasanjo, having missed the official opening of the multi-billion dollar OOPL project. He described the library as a beautiful edifice that should make all Nigerians proud.
“You know I missed the official opening of the library and that is why I have decided to come and see the place and honestly, it is beautiful. We are very proud of what he has done here,” he said.
However, he left the library premises at about 7.12p.m.
