True to its word, the Irish Whiskey brand Jameson has returned with a bang for another exciting experience. This time, it took the party to The Building – an unfinished building — in the heart of the nation’s capital, Abuja. Known for creating unique brand experience, the unfinished building was transformed to a concert ground, lined up with different features that dazzled guests weekend. From the on-site screen printing station, the pop-up barbershop by Luxor, to the music stage, curated by Ade Bantu’s Afropolitan Vibes, The Building was lit. In its usual tradition, the brand connect zone provided a mix of games such as Ayo, Jenga, ping-pong and football for guests to vibe and connect while feasting on the the best gourmet junk food from local vendors. There was also a generous overflow of the Palm Wine Twist — a perfect infusion of Jameson Irish Whiskey, Palm Wine and Naija spirit and other Jameson cocktails. With so much fun and enjoyment, the event came to a climactic note when Burna Boy, straight off his U.S tour, took the stage to a hyped crowd, with songs from his recent album ‘Outside’ as well as oldie but goodie ‘Won Da Mo’ which got the crowd chanting along. The over 300 guests couldn’t hide their excitement as they sang, danced and screamed at the music star. Other artistes like Pretty Boy D-O and Efe Oraka also performed.
