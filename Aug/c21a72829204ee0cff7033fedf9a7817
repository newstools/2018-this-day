Amby Uneze in Owerri Nigeria’s former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, wednesday said the desire to reposition Nigeria and move it forward was the greatest factor motivating him to keep seeking for the highest political office in country. Atiku who spoke when he visited a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu in Owerri , the Imo State capital, noted that bad governance had dragged Nigeria backward. Accompanied by his Director General of his campaign organisation and former Governor of Ogun State, Gbenga Daniel, and other members of his campaign team, said he had the solution to the myriad of challenges confronting the nation. According to him, “patriotism is the key thing. It is the thing propelling my presidential ambition. I want to move Nigeria forward. Patriotism is needed to move Nigeria forward”.
He said he was in the state to consult with the leadership of PDP in the state ahead of the party’s presidential primary. Responding, Iwuanyanywu, said he would not retire from politics until Atiku Abubakar becomes president, adding that the country is in dire need of a leader like Atiku to develop it. “I will not retire from politics until Atiku Abubakar becomes president. Atiku is the kind of president Nigeria needs. There is poverty in the land because of bad governance. Therefore, supporting Atiku is the best thing to do.
“Igbos have been marginalised in this government, sadly, some Igbos people are still supporting Buhari,” he said.
