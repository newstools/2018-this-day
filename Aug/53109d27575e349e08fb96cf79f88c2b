Mohammed Aminu in Sokoto Sokoto State Governor, Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal, wednesday stated that President Muhammadu Buhari is a man of integrity and impeccable character, but too old to steer the affairs of Nigeria. Addressing the various associations, students and youths, who paid him solidarity visit in Sokoto, the state capital, the governor admitted that pressure is being mounted on him to declare for presidency.
He, however, debunked reports that he is one of the enemies of President Buhari. “We love President Buhari and that was why we supported him in 2015 unconditionally, and while doing that, we are too sure that he will seek re-election after his first term, but when things are wrong we have to tell him.
“We still believe in his integrity, patriotism and courage but these are not enough for a leader. “We all know that there is a vacuum in the government occasioned by his disposition probably because of his old age or health condition. That is why Nigerians are yearning for younger ones to lead this country,” he said. The governor alleged that some cabals have hijacked the government and are now discharging the functions and responsibilities of the president. According to him, the country needs somebody who will respect the rule of law and would not be selective in fighting corruption. The governor admitted that pressure is being mounted on him to declare for presidency in 2019.
“I have been receiving support and encouragement from our leaders and people across the country, and even from abroad to contest for president, and this pressure is there. “It is not my making but there’s quantum of pressure from everywhere because of leadership gap in the country. In the next few days, I will make my position public on the matter,” he added.
