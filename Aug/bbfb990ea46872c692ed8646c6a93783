Vanessa Obioha The Senior Pastor of The Rock Cathedral, Lekki, Paul Adefarasin is scheduled to host great men of God in its upcoming Spirit Life Conference. The annual event is part of the church’s mission to impact, empower and spiritually refresh thousands of souls through anointed men of God and music ministers across the country. This year’s edition will feature renowned American televangelist and Pastor, Creflo Dollar; Bishop Mike Okonkwo, Pastor Matthew Ashimolowo and Pastor Ransom Bello. Themed ‘Greater Grace’, the conference will throw light on the unique gift of God’s grace and its greater dimension that can turn impossibilities to possibilities. “Grace is that divine lift that gives you the edge, the advantage and the empowerment to do more than your natural capacity and proficiency can. But there is an even greater dimension which is greater grace,” said Adefarasin. The five-day conference kicks-off on Wednesday, September 5 and will culminate in a super celebration on Sunday, September 9 with music ministration from international gospel artiste Donnie Mclurkin, Vicki Yohe and the Lagos Metropolitan Gospel Choir (LMGC).
