Cameroon’s Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers and Nigeria’s Al-Farouq Aminu of the Portland Trailblazers will lead the continent’s players against Team World at the third NBA Africa Game on Saturday, 4 August in Johannesburg, South Africa. The NBA Africa Game is exclusive to Kwesé and fans will be able to catch the live broadcast on Kwesé’s multiple platforms namely; its free-to-air channel, Kwesé Free Sports (KFS), its satellite TV network, Kwesé TV, as well as stream live on both the Kwesé TV and Kwesé iflix apps. Embiid, who led the 76ers to the Eastern Conference semi-finals in May, will hope to be fit this time around after sitting out last year’s game due to an injury.  Aminu, one of the stars of Nigeria’s national team that won its maiden Afrobasket Men’s Championship in 2015, returns to the continent for the first time since that triumph in Tunisia. The African team will also have Luol Deng of Sudan, a power forward at LA Lakers; Bismarck Biyombo of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Serge Ibaka and Pascal Siakam both of the Toronto Raptors and New Orleans Pelicans’ Cheick Diallo from Mali. Others are Ian Mahimi of the Washington Wizards, Evan Fournier of Orlando Magic and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot of Oklahoma City Thunder. Team World has drafted a group of top NBA players that include LA Lakers’ JaVale McGee San Antonio Spurs’ Rudy Gay, Atlanta Hawks’, John Collins and Dallas Mavericks’ Dennis Smith Jr. all of the United States.
