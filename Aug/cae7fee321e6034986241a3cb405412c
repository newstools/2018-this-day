A fascinating start to the season was witnessed yesterday in Germany and StarTimes have started to deliver some of the most action-packed football from the best players in the world which would air on ST World Football Channels 244 and 254 and ST Sport Premium Channel 246. The new football season debuts with four games live across the opening weekend as the reigning champions Bayern Munich defeated last seasonâ€™s third-placed side, Hoffenheim, at the Allianz Arena. Niko Kovac, who spent two years as a player for Bayern between 2001 and 2003, is the new man in the Bayern dug-out after taking over from Jupp Heynckes. The 46-year-old impressed by rejuvenating Eintract Frankfurt, the side Bayern demolished 5-0 in his opening match in charge to lift the Super Cup earlier this month. Bayern have been uncharacteristically quiet in the transfer market so far but Canadian teenage prodigy Alphonso Davies will arrive in January from the Vancouver Whitecaps. Kovac will also be able to call upon the services of former Arsenal star Serge Gnabry and Renato Sanches, who are back from loans at Hoffenheim and Swansea respectively. Hoffenheim themselves will be eager to build on a sublime 2017-18 campaign with their unheralded but very effective squad. Borussia Monchengladbach take on Bayer Leverkusen today (5.30p.m.), before an enthralling double-header on Sunday, in which Stuttgart travel to Mainz before Borussia Dortmund encounter with RB Leipzig at 5:00pm closes out the action in style on the same channel.
