By Senator Iroegbu in Abuja The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has denied allegation by the Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters, Sen.Babafemi Ojudu, in an article entitled, “fifth Columnists in Our Recent History”, that the Commission is a conscript in the alleged devious plots by Senate President Bukola Saraki to undermine the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari. The Head of Media and Publicity, EFCC, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, in a statement Sunday, said the Commission takes exception to the attempt to impute false motive to its investigative activities. He quoted Ojudu to have said: “From the shenanigans at the Benue House of Assembly, to the siege on National Assembly, the attack on judges home in the night, the so-called barricade of the Senate President’s house, the laughable kidnap of Boy Dino and “his eleven hours on a tree’, the freezing of Benue and Akwa Ibom accounts all are scripted, produced and acted by Oloye Productions”. According to Uwujaren, the recent placement of a ‘Post No Debit Order’ on some accounts in Benue and Akwa Ibom States were the culmination of many months of painstaking investigation activities. He said to reduce such activities to the level of a stunt in a real or imaginary script by any politician is outrageous. “It is important to state that the EFCC is NOT a party to the so called script by Saraki. Members of the public should disregard the innuendo in Ojudu’s article as it is unfounded,” he said. He called for circumspection on the part of political leaders, while urging them to seek clarification before making comments on matters they do not know about.
