Meanwhile, a group of lawmakers in the lower chamber under the auspices of the Parliamentary Democrats Group (PDG) Monday vowed that the call for reconvening of the National Assembly would not be heeded if the intention is to change the leadership of both chambers. The group, in a statement signed by its spokesman, Hon. Timothy Golu, said although their leaders were meeting to consider the appeal from the presidency, the Senate and the House might consider the request only if there are assurances that no attempt would be made to unseat either the Senate president or the speaker and their deputies. Golu said: “Our leaders are meeting to brief us on the appeal by the presidency for us to reconvene. There must be assurance that no illegality will be attempted to be done against any of our leaders. “We are worried by the statements from some anti-Saraki senators like Adamu Abdullahi and Ali Ndume to the fact that the Senate president must be changed.” According to him, “Talks are ongoing and as long as there is no threat to our democratic peace, we can reconvene to attend to issues. “We want peace and stability for our democracy to grow and produce more good fruits and if among ourselves we are found guilty of any form of sabotage for personal reasons, then we are not fair to the people.”
