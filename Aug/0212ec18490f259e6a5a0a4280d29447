Martins Ifijeh A 400-level student of Philosophy at the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Lynda Aigbodega, is in urgent need of N5 million to treat leukemia, which is fast taking a toll on her health. Her ailment was recently compounded by swollen gums, respiratory track issues and weakened blood quality. The Edo State-born, according to her brother, Jesusegun Alagbe, was a very lively lady until about two years ago when she began to experience repeated bouts of headache. The development, he said, grew worse until she was diagnosed with leukemia. Since then, she has received treatment at three hospitals, including the General Hospital, Gbagada, Lagos, and Divine Touch Herbal Clinic, Benin City. According to a medical doctor with Divine Touch, Dr. Solomon Anokhaoya, for Aigbodega to get back on her feet, she requires at least N5 million for a medical trip to India where she will undergo surgery. The patientâ€™s family said they have exhausted all they had on her treatment so far and could not afford the much needed fee, thus necessitating their solicitation to all and sundry to support the much they can. Her account details are: Access Bank; account name: Aigbodega Oyogbo Lynda and account number: 0031025100.
