Willian has hinted that he intends to stay at Chelsea while also confirming that Barcelona made a bid to sign him this summer transfer window. The Brazil winger, 29, has been at Stamford Bridge for five years but was linked with a move this summer. Speaking after the 2-0 Community Shield defeat by Manchester City, he told ESPN Brasil: “I always made it clear that what I wanted was to stay in the club. “The only club I knew that really made an official offer for me was Barcelona.” He has also been linked to Manchester United and Real Madrid – who are also reportedly interested in Blues duo Thibaut Courtois and Eden Hazard. Willian added: “I have my head here and I intend to continue in the club unless the club wants to sell me.” New Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri has only signed two players this summer – Napoli midfielder Jorginho and back-up goalkeeper Rob Green.
