Deji Elumoye in Abuja A member of the National Assembly, Senator Philip Aduda( FCT), has said that he remains a loyal founding member of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP since 1998 Aduda who is the Senate Minority Whip Thursday in Abuja debunked media report that he was planning to defect to the ruling All Progressives Congress ( APC), describing it as false and unfounded. According to him, the report was nothing but figment of imagination of those behind it. He said he had been in PDP since 1998 and never nursed such plan. He specifically said, “I have not defected, I am in People’s Democratic Party( PDP). I am not planning to defect, body and soul, I am in PDP. I am a bonafide PDP member and I am a leader in the PDP, and not only being a leader in PDP but I am a loyal member of the party from my ward to national level. “We must continue to build not only institutions but parties. And as such my ideology is with the PDP and I am still a member of the PDP.” On the defection of former Senate Minority Leader, Senator Godswill Akpabio, to All Progressive Congress ( APC), Aduda said though Akpabio was his friend, his defection to the ruling party cannot affect his own decision to remain with the PDP. “You should know that politics has nothing to do with friendship and as such, we have our political differences. “For me I want to reiterate that I worked very hard for the people of FCT and nothing will hamper me from working for the people of FCT. So, Akpabio has his reasons for leaving PDP but for me, I will continue to serve the PDP and I am loyal to my party,” he said.
