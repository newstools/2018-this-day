Senator Iroegbu in Abuja The Department of State Services (DSS) has said the video circulating on social media in which several items were said to have been recovered from the Katsina and Abuja homes of its immediate past Director General, Lawal Daura, is fake. The DSS in a statement signed by Mr. Tony Opuiyo, on Monday described as non-existent, the alleged recovery of N21bn cash; 400 assorted and sophisticated small arms and light weapons/rifles; and thousands of Permanent Voter’s Cards (PVCs) belonging to Niger Republic immigrants. Opuiyo noted that in another video also in circulation, some persons believed to be personnel of a security outfit were seen forcing open safes stocked with money. He said that the security operatives, who were described as executing a recovery operation at the Katsina home of the former DG, SSS were faked.
“Consequently, the service wishes to inform the public that these videos are false and should be disregarded. So far, no such recovery operations have been undertaken by the EFCC or any other security agency at DSS’ office or residences of the former DG,” he said. He stressed that different interests had continued to give varied accounts of the incident of last week at the National Assembly.
He, however, recalled that the presidency had pledged to carry out a detailed investigation regarding the alleged National Assembly siege. He advised members of the public to exercise restraint in their narration of events and as such, desist from spreading fake news or engaging in activities that may mislead or further cause a breach of the peace as well as preempt the outcome of investigations.
