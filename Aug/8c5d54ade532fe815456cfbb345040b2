 Design drawings filed to the Brazilian National Institute of Industrial Property show what looks like a production BMW X7. These filings are good news for lovers of the concept. The design drawings show that the X7 will retain its huge kidney grilles (albeit slightly more reasonably sized than the concept’s) as well as its overall profile and a few of its fancier design cues. Though some of the more baroque flourishes have been eliminated (the vertical bits of aluminum on the rear quarter panel and the front bumper, for example) the overall impression is very similar to the concept. With its sharp headlights, its 7 Series-esque hockey stick, and near identical glass, the X7 shouldn’t be a big surprise when it comes out. At 200-inches long, you won’t miss this big boy on the road, either. Expected to weigh around 5,000 lbs, it will fit up to seven people. We expect power to come from a 4.4-liter V8 funnelled to the wheels through an 8-speed automatic. Coscharis Motors represents BMW in Nigeria. (Source: autoguide)
