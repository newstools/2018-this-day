Lest you think that Anita Ibru is just another victim of over-exaggerated spinsterhood gone awry, she isn’t. In fact, the mother of two had once been married to a Ghanaian, Marcel Kouassigan. They got married in 2012 and the marriage crashed years after. Burnt and severely disillusioned by her unsavory experience in wedlock, she never misses an opportunity to impress it on her friends that marriage isn’t anywhere near the top of the list of her priorities, at least for now. Anita has put the emotional trauma and all the baggage heartbreak behind her in order to focus on more important endeavours like raising her children and growing her business. And she is doing very well. She has reverted to her maiden name, which she probably felt commanded more respect.
