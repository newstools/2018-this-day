FIFA has warned Ghana government to withdraw the court action seeking to dissolve the Ghana Football Association by Monday, 27 August, 2018 or face its wrath. World football governing body said yesterday that it will ban the country from all football activities that would affect next month’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Kenya. The action will also prevent Ghana from hosting of the Africa Women’s Championship which is scheduled to be held in the country from November. Widespread local media reports claim FIFA has forwarded the letter to the Sports Ministry and that is rattling cages in the West African country. If the authorities fail to comply with this latest directive, Ghana would be handed a worldwide ban, meaning no club or national team can compete in international competitions. The court action is deemed to be government interference in the sport as the laws of FIFA prohibit governments from interfering in the activities of football federations. Football in the country came to a halt in June after an Accra High Court granted an application by the Attorney General to enable government dissolve the local football governing body. The Attorney General headed following an explosive revelation by investigative journalist Anas Armeyaw where some officials and referees were caught on tape taking bribes. The expose lead to the resignation of Ghana FA President Kwesi Nyantakyi who was captured on tape receiving $65,000 ‘gift’ to agree a sponsorship deal with supposed investors- something he is contesting in court claiming it was a refund of his expenses. He resigned on Friday, June 8, after FIFA handed him a 90-day provisional ban from all footballing activities. Over 80 referees and football officials were involved in the bribery scandal which has rocked the GFA.
