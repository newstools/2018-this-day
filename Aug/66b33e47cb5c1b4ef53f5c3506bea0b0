By Kayode Fasua Gombe State governor, Alhaji Ibrahim Dankwambo, is in the presidential race to replicate his developmental strides in Gombe at the national level, and not to flex muscles with others currently in the race, his spokesman, Mr.Junaid Usman Abubakar, has said. Abubakar, who is Senior Special Assistant on Press Affairs to Governor Dankwambo, in a chat with our correspondent, said his principal had high regards for all his co-contestants in the Peoples Democratic Party, especially former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, “who is like a father to him.” “Governor Dankwambo will never be a party to mudslinging or disparaging his co-contestants as his scorecard in Gombe in the last seven and half years is enough evidence before discerning Nigerians that he will not only replicate that feat at the national level, but do much more,” the governor’s aide explained. Abubakar said that Dankwambo had proved his mettle both as Accountant General of the Federation and Gombe State governor respectively, with unprecedented scorecards. “As accountant-general, Dankwambo built an imposing treasury house in Abuja, introduced e-payment, and even enhanced human development by being instrumental to the elevation of nine directors to the level of permanent secretary. “Dankwambo is indeed, a genius; despite that Gombe is the second lowest in the rating of federal allocations to states, the governor was able to construct 1,750 kilometres of roads in both urban and rural areas. “Also, he was able to build 600 blocks of classrooms in various public schools and set up six tertiary institutions, which include a University of Science and Technology,” Abubakar explained. He also noted that with the governor’s tireless efforts at improving the lot of the people through aggressive infrastructural works and job provisions, he had proved to all that having lifted the standard of living in Gombe, he could do the same thing nationwide, if given the chance to rule. “Besides, Dankwambo is young and agile enough to cope with the challenges of ruling a country as big as Nigeria,” he stressed.
