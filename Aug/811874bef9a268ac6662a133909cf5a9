If the first-team squad numbers announced by Wolverhampton Wanderers on Friday afternoon are anything to go by, Nigerian-born wonderkid Bright Enobakhare is in line to make his Premier League debut this season. Enobakhare has been handed the number 14 shirt for the entirety of the 2018-2019 campaign. Last season, the highly-rated young striker wore the number 26 shirt 21 times in the Championship as Wolves secured promotion to the Premier League, the same number he donned during the 2016-2017 campaign. Enobakhare played with the number 48 kit when he made his first-team debut for Wolves in a League Cup tie against Barnet on August 25, 2015. The 20-year-old has worn the number 9, 10, 15, 16, 17 shirts for the youth teams of Wolverhampton Wanderers. In 49 outings for Wolves’ first team, Enobakhare, who joined the club at the age of 15, has found the net on three occasions. Wolves face Everton at the Molineux Stadium in their Premier League curtain-raiser on Saturdaybefore a trip to Leicester City next weekend.
