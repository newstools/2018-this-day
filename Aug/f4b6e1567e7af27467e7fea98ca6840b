By Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja The immediate past Deputy National Publicity Secretary of All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Timi Frank, has  dumped the party. Frank said he was leaving the APC to continue his opposition  against injustice, intimidation, political persecution and criminalisation of all opponents of the ruling party.
Frank, who however did not indicate whether he would be joining another political party soon, said he was ready again to contribute his quota to the progress and development of Nigeria by joining hands with progressive forces to rescue the country from collapse, poverty, corruption, tyranny, ignominy and undemocratic leadership. In a statement Frank released on Friday, he thanked his supporters, both home and abroad, for their encouragement during his stay in the APC which he said has continued to be a soothing balm “under this arid regime and also to inform them of my decision, after extensive reflection and consultations, to leave the APC and to commence afresh the struggle to reestablish the rule of law, respect for the fundamental human rights of Nigerians and the restoration of justice, fairness and equity in the conduct of affairs in this country, irrespective of the personality that may be at the helm of affairs at any given time.”
