Roma has signed Sevilla midfielder Steven Nzonzi in a deal that could be worth up to 30.6m euros (£27.3m). The French World Cup winner, formerly of Blackburn Rovers and Stoke, had been linked with a move to Arsenal in July. He leaves Spanish club Sevilla after three years, during which time he won the Europa League in 2016. Nzonzi, 29, has signed a four-year contract, with Roma to pay an initial 26.6m euros (£23.7m), and another 4m euros (£3.6m) in potential add-ons. Italian club Roma, who finished third in Serie A last season, begins their new league campaign on Sunday, away to Torino in a 17:00 BST kick-off.
