Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja The All Progressives Congress (APC) has condemned, what it described as the unfortunate invasion of the National Assembly by security forces. The ruling party which had earlier issued a statement disassociating itself from the ugly incident, said last night that it believed in the independence of the legislature. The APC statement reads: “Our party wholly dissociates itself from any act of brigandage and affront on the sacred symbols of our budding democracy. “Our party remains a law abiding political organisation and advises every constituent part to abide by the tenets of our constitution and our democracy. “Whilst our contention with the leadership of the National Assembly as currently constituted is a matter of public record, we still believe that the legislature as an independent arm of government must be allowed free reign for vibrant contestation of ideas and values amongst its members within the context of their constitutional mandate and for the benefit of the Nigerian people. “We call for a more harmonious working relationship between the various Arms of Government in the general interest of the country”..
