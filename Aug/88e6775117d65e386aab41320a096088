Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The African Democratic Congress (ADC) will Saturday hold its state congress in Yola, the Adamawa State capital, for delegates to elect the members of the State Working Committee (SWC). The state congress, according to a statement issued on Friday in Abuja by the National Publicity Secretary, Chief Anayo Arinze, is the grand finale of the internal democracy exercise which started in Adamawa State on Wednesday, with the ward congresses where party members were allowed to choose their leaders. He said that the party held congresses at the local government areas on Thursday, August 2, 2018, where the ward delegates and other constitutionally recognised delegates converged to democratically elect their leaders. Arinze said: “It is noteworthy that all the congresses at the wards and the local government areas were hitch-free, rancour-free, free, fair and credible.” He explained that the ADC congresses held so far at the wards and local government areas in the state were strictly observed by officers of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) at relevant levels and, adjudged as unique and exemplary given the crises-ridden congresses organised by other parties in the past. Arinze stated: “It has been so far, so good as there were no fractionalize or parallel congresses, no petitions against the electoral processes and record of violence anywhere in the state. “On Saturday, 4th August, 2018, the last batch of the scheduled congresses in Adamawa will be held at the state level in Yola, the Adamawa State capital, for delegates to elect the members of the State Working Committee (SWC).” He stressed that ADC has been known as the party with character, focus and integrity which is being positioned to take over power at all levels in Nigeria.
