By Nume Ekeghe Ecobank Nigeria Limited has rewarded its Xpress Account holders for using the account. Head of Direct Banking Ecobank, Mr. Philip Sonibare, said the offer rewards customers for transacting on their Ecobank Xpress account. According to him, there are also instant gifts for transacting at Ecobank Xpress Points across the country. Responding to media questions in Lagos, he explained that the “Xpress Account Giveaway rewards customers who had opened an Xpress account via the Ecobank Mobile app or its USSD code. “Our checks show that many customers have opened Xpress account in the last few weeks as a result of the reward scheme. Opening the account is simple, without documentation or any need to visit the bank”. Sonibare emphasised that, “with the Xpress account, one can buy airtime, transfer money to any bank account in the country, deposit and withdraw cash at any Xpress Agent Point, do cardless withdrawals (XpressCash) at either an Ecobank ATM or Xpress point location, as well as pay regular bills.” On the dynamics of the promo, Sonibare said, “the reward is in two categories- cash back and instant prizes at Xpress points. To be eligible for the cash back, customers need to make 3 transactions a week (cumulative minimum of N3, 000) to get cash back of N500 at the start of the following week. “Customers who visit any of our Xpress points to carry out transactions will also receive instant free gifts provided the transaction value is up to N2,000.” He affirmed that customers “could win as often as they transact and as long as they meet the minimum requirements to qualify.”
