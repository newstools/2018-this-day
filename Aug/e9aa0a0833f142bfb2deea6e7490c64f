World football governing body, FIFA, has confirmed that Nigeria will not be suspended following Federal Government’s directive that Amaju Pinnick-led executive committee remains the legitimate board of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). A statement from FIFA this Monday afternoon read: “Following the decision of the Bureau of the FIFA Council of 13 August, 2018 concerning the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), FIFA received confirmations that the legitimate leadership of the NFF under President Amaju Melvin Pinnick and General Secretary Mohammed Sanusi has been given back effective control of the NFF and its offices. “In view of these circumstances, FIFA deems that the conditions set by the decision of the Bureau of the FIFA Council have now been met and consequently the suspension of the NFF will not take effect. “FIFA will continue to closely monitor the situation in order to ensure that FIFA’s rules and regulations are fully adhered to.” Earlier on Monday, Laolu Akande, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media, Office of the Vice President, had tweeted FG’s position on the leadership tussle  at the Glass House, insisting that  the Amaju Pinnick-led executive committee remains the authentic board of the NFF. The statement was a follow up on the communication between the Vice President, Pinnick and FIFA at the weekend. Nigeria was to be handed a lengthy ban this afternoon, a development that would have thrown Super Eagles qualification for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations into jeopardy. After missing the AFCON 2012  in similar fashion but came back to win the 2013 edition in South Africa, squabble over the coveted NFF post led to Eagles failing to qualify for the 2015 and 2017 editions in a row.
