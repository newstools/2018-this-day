By Yinka Kolawole in OSOGBO The governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the forthcoming governorship election in Osun state, Senator Iyiola Omisore has debunked insinuations that he was planinng to return to the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP). Addressing journalists at the weekend shortly after paying homage to the Owa Obokun of Ijesaland, Oba Gabriel Adekunle Aromolaran in his palace at Ilesa as part of the programme to flag off his campaign, Omisore said rather than move to the party, a lot of PDP chieftains would soon join his campaign train. Omisore who revealed an alleged plan by Governor Rauf Aregbesola to ensure that Osun State remains indebted to him and his cronies for at least a period of fifteen years even after leaving office, said the plan was embedded in a fake contract documents. “Even as we speak, Aregbesola’s Government has started preparing post contract ‘variation reports’ on all projects executed by it for the past eight years. “It is against this background that the struggle and contest for continuity by the APC and its offshoot in the ADP is situated and should be understood by all” Omisore said. Earlier, Oba Aromolaran who prayed for the success of Omisore however, said as traditional ruler, his role is to ensure that peace reigns before, during and after the September 22 governorship election in his domain.
