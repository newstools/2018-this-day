*Meeting deliberates on disturbing security report from North-east Omololu Ogunmade in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari Monday resumed duty in the State House, Abuja, presiding over a security council meeting and ordering the service chiefs to raise the tempo of security operations in the country with a view to guaranteeing peace and safety of citizens.
Buhari had returned from a 10-day working vacation to the United Kingdom on Saturday and immediately transmitted a letter to the National Assembly, announcing his return to Nigeria and consequent take over of the reins of power from Vice-president Yemi Osinbajo, who had acted in that capacity since August 3.
Briefing journalists at the end of the meeting which lasted for two and half hours, the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Gabriel Olonisakin, said the meeting reviewed security situations in all parts of the country and participants made submissions. Also speaking, the Minister of Defence, Col. Mansur Dan-Ali (rtd.), saidÂ whereas the meeting received disturbing security reports from the North-east, reports from Benue, Zamfara States and the Niger Delta showed a great degree of improvement. However, he said the North-east situation had been critically looked into and the council had taken a decision on how to address it.
