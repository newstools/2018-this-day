Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja The publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, has emerged the protem national chairman of the newly registered African Action Congress (AAC). AAC was among the 23 new political parties unveiled on Wednesday by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Addressing party faithful, Sowore said the party’s unique ideology was a clear departure from other parties’. Speaking on the evolution of AAC, Sowore, who is also a presidential aspirant, said: “First we started this as a movement and it has distinguished itself in the last six months as a movement that is driven by a strong vision to change Nigeria for the better”. He said the new party had been able to distinguish itself within a short period of its existence. Sowore whose party drew a large chunk of its members from the youth constituency, assured that its activities and work plan will be tailored to satisfy the yearnings of this critical segment of the society. “With today’s declaration, Nigerians and indeed the world has been served a notice that a different political party is born with unique orientation. We are different by energy, we are different by capacity and even by our patriotism,” he said. When asked to comment on the ongoing controversy over the signing of the amended Electoral Act and the issue of the supplementary budget for the Independent National Electoral Commission, Sowore said the party may be forced to mobilise Nigerians to confront those seeking to sabotage the 2019 elections if need be.
