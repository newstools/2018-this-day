Rebecca Ejifoma A non-governmental organisation, Community Life Project, has begun its 2019 campaign for artisans across the country to air their views on possible challenges facing the 2019 general elections. This platform, which is mainly for grassroots Nigerians, aims to bring artisans together and solve the problems commonly faced during campaigns and elections. The organisation revealed this at the town hall meeting and roundtable held at Isolo Lagos State. The Programme Manager, Francis Onahor, said the campaign meeting was part of sensitisation. He said, “What we did was to start the campaign. Politicians are not sleeping. Right now, governance is going at a slow pace because they are all thinking about the 2019 election rather than the people”. Addressing the participants – CDAs, faith-based organisation, NATA, NACHA, traders, barbers and stylists among several others – Onahor told them that power belonged to the people. He said, “Our message is 2019 election, the power belongs to the people not to politicians.” “As a platform for social movement of grassroots’, citizens are working to enthrone democratic accountability and inclusive development.” The project manager described the meeting as important for the people to air their opinions in the electoral process for 2019.
