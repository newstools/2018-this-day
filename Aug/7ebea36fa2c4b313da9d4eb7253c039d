 Leicester City striker Islam Slimani has completed his season-long switch to Turkish side Fenerbahce, the Premier League club announced on Sunday. Algerian international Slimani joined the former Premier League champions from Portuguese side Sporting in 2016 and scored 13 goals in 46 appearances in all competitions. Slimani, 30, struggled to nail down a starting spot in the Leicester squad and was loaned to Newcastle United last season. Fenerbahce, who were runners-up to Galatasaray in the Turkish Super Lig last season, kicked off their campaign with a 2-1 win at home to Bursaspor on Saturday. Leicester, who were beaten 2-1 by Manchester United in their season openerÂ on Friday, host Wolverhampton Wanderers next weekend.
