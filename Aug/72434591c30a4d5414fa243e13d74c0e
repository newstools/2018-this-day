Emmanuel Ukumba in Lafia The National Assembly members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are keeping vigil at the premises of the assembly complex to forestall any impeachment process against the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki. This was disclosed wednesday in Lafia, the Nasarawa State capital by the Senator representing Nasarawa North senatorial zone, Philip Aruwa Gyunka, when he presented his letter of intent to contest the governorship seat of the state to the officials of the state PDP. “I woke up this morning from my night shift and I will still be going back to my night shift. That is to say we are keeping vigil.We are rotating the shift among ourselves. “As regards to what they are saying about impeachment, it is not possible because the international community is aware of their plot. “Don’t be discouraged. They will intimidate you as they do to us. Like myself, I don’t know how many times they have been calling me. We didn’t know they have come to truncate democracy. But the Senate president, being a product of PDP, has come to the rescue of the situation,” he said. The senator told the PDP supporters that he would bring to the office of the governor of the state “the heart of a servant who had known hard times, tasted poverty and acquired requisite discipline to govern. “I shall bring the benefits of my vast experience as an economist, banker, and a legislator at both state and federal levels to reform and transform the state. I will bring a new vision and new direction to governance that will be truly democratic, representative and professional to deliver and redeem the state from its downward descent,” Gyunka said. In his response, the state PDP chairman, Hon. Francis Orogu, said the state chapter of party was proud of its representatives at the National Assembly and consequently encouraged them to maintain the tempo of their loyalty to the PDP.
