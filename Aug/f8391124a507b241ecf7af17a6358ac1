A South African court Thursday postponed hearings in a culpable homicide case against former president Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane until October 26, after his lawyers asked for more time to prepare his defence. The 34-year-old appeared in court, accompanied by his father, to face two charges over a car crash in 2014 when his Porsche 911 plowed into a minivan taxi in Johannesburg, killing one woman and injuring another who later died. State prosecutors initially decided not to charge Duduzane, who denies any wrongdoing. The National Prosecuting Authority reversed its decision after Duduzane’s father was ousted as head of state by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in February. The father and son left the pre-trial hearing on Thursday without making a comment. Last month, Duduzane appeared in leg irons at another Johannesburg court on corruption charges, which his lawyers say he will contest. He was released on bail of 100,000 rand ($6,800).(Reuters)
