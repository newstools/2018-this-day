D’Tigress Point Guard, Kalu Ezinne, has demanded extra focus from her team mates as they start the second phase of their camping in Lagos today in preparation for the 2018 FIBA Women’s World Cup in Spain. The 26-year old who plays for Vasa Akademia in the Hungarian league said the team’s mission in Lagos is to finish the second phase on a high note in time for World Cup. “I expect everybody to have a solid focus. We are ready to finish the second part of camp and get a solid defence going. I expect that everybody will come in and stay focused because the second phase of the camp is the most important,” she noted at the weekend. According to the former co-captain of the team, going by the statistics of the friendlies played during the first phase of their camping in Atlanta, USA, the team’s offence has been great. She expects that D’Tigress can always get better with more warm up games lined up by the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF). Ezinne who played a pivotal role in D’Tigress’ emergence as African Champions in 2017 while speaking on arrival in Lagos said putting on the national team’s jersey and representing millions of Nigerians comes with a bit of pressure on any player which for her is normal. “I do feel the pressure but at the same time, I know that my team has got my back. They can trust me and I can trust them and help me keep being a leader,” she stressed. Despite the recent appointment of Adaora Elonu as captain, Ezinne said she will continue to play her leadership role on the court and give her best to bring glory to Nigeria anytime she steps on the court. “As a point guard, I have to be a leader on the floor, talking with my team mates and getting the job done,” she concluded.
