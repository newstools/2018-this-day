If you hear that the family and friends of Lekan Osifeso, Chairman, Lekai Construction, are organising a prayer and fasting session, you don’t have to sneer at them. For them, only God deserves their praise and worship for sparing the life of their beloved Osifeso, who was recently involved in an accident. The socialite, it was gathered, was on his way from Abuja to Iseyin in Oyo State when the accident occurred. Those in the know claimed that the socialite was travelling to attend Shina Peller’s declaration for the House of Reps, when the car he was travelling in somersaulted. He was said to have sustained injuries in his neck and arms. It was further gathered that friends are contemplating flying him out of the country for better treatment.
