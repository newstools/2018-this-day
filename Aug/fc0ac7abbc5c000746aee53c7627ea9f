By Kasim Sumaina in Abuja The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has said it has commenced a process of partnership with the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) to strengthen the provision of quick and appropriate emergency medical assistance to disaster victims in the country. NEMA, in a statement by its Head, Media and Public Relations, Sani Datti in Abuja, noted that a Bilateral Technical Working Group (BTWG) has been established between the agency and the NMA to draw up details of the working relationship. According to the statement, the Director General of NEMA, Mr. Mustapha Maihaja, met with the national executives of the NMA in Abuja at the weekend to identify the imperatives for the partnership and actively engage members of the association in addressing gaps in the provision of medical supports in the aftermath of disaster incidents. “Though there were a number of medical personnel in NEMA, response to disaster situations would always require more professionals to guide and direct us appropriately. “The partnership with the NMA would avail the services of specialists in various medical fields to deal with situations such as malnutrition among Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), deployment of First Aid by emergency workers and advocacy against environmental health issues among others,” Maihaja explained.
