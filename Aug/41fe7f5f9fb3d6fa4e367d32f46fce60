They include; Skipper Rasheedat Ajibade, who has scored both of the Nigerian team’s goals in the ongoing tournament. Four of the girls that played for Spain in Papua New Guinea are in the squad in France.

To reach this stage, the Falconets defeated Haiti 1-0 and drew 1-1 with China, after an opening –day 0-1 loss to perennial foes Germany in Saint Malo.
