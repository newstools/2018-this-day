The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has inaugurated a 16-man Committee for the 2018 Edo State Festival for Arts and Culture (EDOFEST), with a charge to promote the rich culture of the people. At the inauguration of the Committee held in Government House in Benin City, Edo State capital, Obaseki urged the committee to use the occasion of the event to promote Edo’s rich cultural heritage as a force of unity and progress. “We have huge plans for tourism in Edo State. One key anchor of our thematic pillars is to emphasise tourism and culture which are major assets we have as a state,” he added. The governor said his administration intends to market the people’s rich culture as there are fewer states in Nigeria that can boast of such quality and diversity of culture. Obaseki said his administration is committed to hosting the festival in 2018 as expectations are high, noting that the best is expected from the committee. The Chairman EDOFEST Committee and Commissioner for Arts, Culture, Tourism and Diaspora Affairs, Hon. Osaze Osemwegie-Ero, expressed appreciation to the governor for the confidence in the committee and assured the governor that the Committee will not fail in their responsibility. “We will do our best to make the event memorable and ensure 2018 festival is better than 2017,” he added.
