By Wole Ayodele in Jalingo In a bid to forestall violent attacks on Corps members during the 2019 general elections, the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Independent National Electoral Commission   (INEC) to guarantee the safety of Corp members. The Director General of NYSC, Brig. Gen. Suleiman Kazaure, who stated this in Jalingo on Friday, during a working tour to the orientation camp in Taraba State, said NYSC would stop at nothing to ensure that the lives of Corp members that would work as ad-hoc staff were adequately protected. According to him, Corp members would work as ad- hoc staff for the elections but we have signed a memorandum of understanding with INEC which will guarantee the safety of the live of every Corp member. Besides, the DG noted that NYSC was in constant touch with other security agencies as part of efforts to ensure that every Corp member is adequately secured. Addressing the 2018 Batch B Corp members at the orientation camp, Kazaure charged them to lead the campaign against drug abuse in order to engender a better society. In his words, As graduates, you should avoid all social vices especially drug abuse which is one of the leading causes of problems in the society today. Lead other youth in shunning the menace and other anti-social behaviours for a better country.Similarly, General Kazaure enjoined the corps members to be security conscious and avoid moving alone in the course of their service year as well as respect the culture and tradition of their host communities. The DG equally revealed that a committee had been set up to review their monthly allowances just as he expressed optimism that the process would be concluded very soon. Earlier in her welcome address, the NYSC Coordinator in Taraba State, Florence Yaakugh said a total of 1,807 corps members were registered for the 2018 Batch B orientation course.
