Paul Inyang, CEO, Megaplux Global Access, is a testament to the popular saying “A man who is diligent in his profession would sit before kings.” The story of Paulo, as he is famously called, is that of a man who has risen from nothingness to prominence owing to hard work, creativity and innovation. Armed with a master’s degree from the University of Calabar, Cross River State, Paul, who is said to be planning big for the birthday of his beautiful wife, Deola, had dreamed to be a voice in the branding world. Pronto, he set up his then mini branding firm with a paltry sum. Interestingly, 11 years after, Paul has not only succeeded as a frontline brand pusher, but has become a global phenomenon, with rich clientele. In recognition of his feat, Paul will again, be honoured with a deserving award on September 23, in Frankfurt, Germany, as his company, Megaplux, will receive an International Award in Excellence and Quality (IAEQ) in the Gold Category at the 32nd International Quality
