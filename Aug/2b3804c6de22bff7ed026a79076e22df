  Deji Elumoye in Abuja  Senate President Bukola Saraki has said the former Governor of Lagos state, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, is supporting the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari blindly because of his presidential ambition in 2023. Saraki, in a release titled: ‘The Tinubu Rhetoric’ in response to Tinubu’s allegation that uncertainty over automatic ticket made him to leave the APC for PDP, declared that Tinubu will rather “support a Buhari on the hospital stretcher to get a second term because in 2023, power will shift to the South-west.” This Tinubu viewpoint, Saraki stressed, was not only expressed to him “but to several of my colleagues, so much for acting in national interest.” He said  the relationship between him and Tinubu became frosty in 2014 when he opposed the ambition of Tinubu to run as Buhari’s running mate on a Muslim/ Muslim ticket. “My present uncertain and complex relationship with Tinubu has been continually defined by the event of 2014 when myself and other leaders of the APC opposed the Muslim-Muslim ticket arrangement about to be foisted on the APC for the 2015 polls. “It should be noted that he has not forgotten the fact that I took the bull by the horns and told him that in the interest of the country, he should accept the need for the party to present a balanced ticket for the 2015 General Elections in terms of religion and geo-political zones. Since that time he has been very active, plotting at every point to undermine me, within and outside the National Assembly,” Saraki further said.  Details later…
