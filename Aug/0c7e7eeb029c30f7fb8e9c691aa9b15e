By Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja Paul Kyari-Lassa at the weekend won the Cola Cola Golf Tournament and plotted his way to Mauritius Open in November. Lassa carded 70 nett to win the men’s competition at the IBB International Golf and Country Club, Abuja.

Six Nigerian amateur golfers drawn from Ikoyi, Abuja and Ibadan golf clubs will make the party to Anahita Golf and Spa, Resort in Mauritius, which is listed on the European Tour. A field of 128 golfers, including invited customers, competed at the Abuja leg of the18-hole tournament. Lassa, who now plays off handicap 17.4, attributed his surge to victory to good weather. He said he will bank on his international exposure to excel in Anahita. “I played a very good golf to win. My projection in Mauritius is to win. I have represented IBB Club in the past and have been to so many places. I will go and play well and have fun and make friends. “It is my first time of going to Mauritius, but I am confident it will be a memorable outing because I have played in the US, when I won MTN Tournament and played a blind course and returned 72 net,” Lassa said. The GM Stills, West African Business Unit, Coca Cola, Yebeltal Getachew, said the six Nigerian winners will be part of the all-expense paid trip to Mauritius Open, where they will feature in a Pro-Am with other international players before the main Mauritius Open.

Over there, they will play in the Pro-Am of the Mauritius Open on a championship course, which is listed on the European Tour,” Getachew said.
