*May release Eagles’ list for Seychelles Super Eagles Technical Adviser, Gernot Rohr, is expected to arrive in Nigeria today after his extended holiday post-World Cup in Russia. Top NFF sources confirmed at the weekend that the Franco-German gaffer will hit ground plotting how to prosecute Nigeria’s Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON 2019) qualifying match next month away to Seychelles. The match is to be played on Saturday September 8 at the 10,000-capacity Stad Linité in Victoria, the capital city of Seychelles. Rohr who is expected to release the list of players invited for the AFCON 2019 qualifier, is also to visit Asaba to inspect the Stephen Keshi Stadium to find out if suitable to host the Match-Day 3 qualifier against Libya on Wednesday October 10, 2018. He is to among other things inspect the playing turf of the stadium which hosted the 21st African Senior Athletics Championships early this month. The manager is also expected to inspect the Grand Hotel at Nnebisi Road in Asaba to access its suitability for the huge game. Super Eagles lost their first game of the qualifying series to South Africa in Uyo.
