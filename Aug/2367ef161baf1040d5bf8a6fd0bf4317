Prison inmates languishing in major Nigerian prisons are in for a momentary treat, as one of Nigeria’s exciting apps, My Neighbours Kitchen, in collaboration with Kokun Foundation will be embarking on a Feed the Inmates Campaign.
The app will be leading hundreds of volunteers and humanitarian workers to major prison centers with truckload of goodies to feed the inmates on August 10.
Also on board is Girl Hub Africa, a non-governmental organisation dedicated to exposing Nigerian youths, particularly the female folks, to the culture of volunteering. My Neighbours Kitchen app is a magical app that’s basically designed to create additional income for food lovers and cooks in this part of the world.
