Senator Iroegbu in Abuja The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arrested a former Director-General of the Department of State Services (DSS), Ita Ekpeyong. He is currently being interrogated by EFCC investigators. This is coming barely 48 hours after his successor, Mr. Lawal Daura, was sacked by Acting President Yemi Osinbajo over the unathorised siege to the National Assembly by DSS operatives on Tuesday. The Head of Media and Publicity, EFCC, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, confirmed to THISDAY that Ekpeyong’s residence at Maman Nasir Street, Asokoro in Abuja, was on Thursday searched by the operatives of the agency. “Yes our men went to his house to search and interrogate him,” Uwujaren said. The EFCC first attempt to arrest Ekpeyong 10 months ago was fiercely resisted by a detachment of DSS personnel under the directive of the then DG Daura.
