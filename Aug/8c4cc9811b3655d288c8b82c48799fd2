After initial boast, which was punctured by an investigative report, that he would be taking delivery of a private jet he had purchased a couple of months ago, the pop star, David Adeleke, popularly known as Davido has not only eaten the humble pie but also regurgitated it in humility after his failed second attempt to claim ownership of the private jet recently acquired by his father, Deji Adeleke. The singer had courted controversy in May when he revealed that he was awaiting the arrival of his newly acquired private jet in two weeks from the time he went on social media. He even released some documents in a bid to lend credence to his claim but the barely legible documents were immediately rubbished as some fabrication from a pit of lies, as they did not reflect anything to justify he had bought a jet except showing Challenger 605 valued at $27 million. The net worth of the’30 Billion’ crooner was also called to questions by critics who opined that he does not have the wherewithal to own a private jet. It was revealed that what Davido was celebrating as buying a jet was a plan to enter fractional ownership with a jet company, an arrangement that does not confer ownership on him. However, he continued with the false ownership when he took pictures on a certain jet with his partner, Chioma on his way to Cotonou, in Benin. In what appeared to be a move to counter Davido’s claim, pictures of Davido’s father and his friends praying on the said private jet showed up and went viral. The images were accompanied by captions that revealed that Davido’s father owned the jet. Seeing that he has been boxed into a corner, he waxed philosophical saying that his father’s assets were as good as his, just as his are as good as to his daughter’s.
