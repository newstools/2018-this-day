According to the statement, Maihaja, hinted that the amendment to the NEMA Act was desirable to ameliorate some identified gaps in the management of disasters in the country. He requested the NBA to be “in the vanguard of ensuring that NEMA Act, which is currently undergoing reform at the National Assembly is treated expeditiously” and in a manner as to ensure that Agency is made to be more robust, more focused, resilient, proactive and better handled. “This will enable the Agency confront many challenges it is facing currently,” he said. Maihaja also expressed his desire that NBA will in due course evolve strategy to actively partner with the agency to ensure adequate protection of human Rights of the internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), expose human right abuses, if any, and provide free legal service to IDPs when need arises. “The federal government through various initiatives has continued to undertake drastic palliative measures aimed at providing necessary succour to victims of disasters in the country,” he added.
