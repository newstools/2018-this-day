The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Solomon Dalung, has said that the intervention of the Presidency in the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) leadership crisis was temporary measure as the matter has a subsisting judgment of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. In a statement issued yesterday by Nneka Ikem Anibeze, Media Assistant to Dalung, though the minister welcomed the intervention of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in the NFF leadership crisis which saved Nigeria from a suspension threat by FIFA, it was mere attempt to abate an escalating case. “This crisis cannot be solved with a temporary measure or scratched on the surface. The intervention of the Vice President should not be viewed as different from an attempt to abate an escalating situation. “ He said that as a lawyer, he prefers to stand on Rule of Law instead of the opinion of men. “As a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, who took oath of office to protect and defend the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, I will prefer to stand with the Rule of Law instead of the opinion of men. “I want to appeal to Nigerians to remain calm and give support to the NFF Elders Stakeholders Reconciliation Committee which is made up of reputable past presidents and general secretaries of the NFF with vast knowledge, experience and competence to resolve this crisis once and for all. “We are a constitutional democracy and the doctrine of separation of powers is the foundation of democratic experience, therefore, the Rule of Law is the only mechanism that guarantees liberty and freedom of citizens “This administration was elected on the change mantra meaning that impunity has no accommodation anywhere, so Nigerians must learn to believe and practice the doctrine of the Rule of Law. “I believe we shall overcome this if we remain within the confines and dictates of the laws of our country. “As we celebrate Sallah, let’s remain law abiding citizens,” Dalung concluded.
