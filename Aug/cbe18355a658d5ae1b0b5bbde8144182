Nume Ekeghe Union Bank has announced its partnership with TEDxLagos for its upcoming event scheduled for Saturday, August 18, 2018. The partnership is part of the bank’s efforts to support and promote development in the country. TEDx is a global platform created in the spirit of TED’s mission, “ideas worth sharing.” According to a statement, the Lagos event would focus on bringing together some of Nigeria’s best minds; entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs, professionals, innovators and reformers to share thought provoking ideas that will encourage decisive action for the benefit of the society. Speaking on the bank’s partnership with TEDxLagos, the Head of Corporate Communications and Marketing at Union Bank, Ogochukwu Ekezie-Ekaidem said, “Union Bank is excited about this partnership with TEDxLagos; a platform synonymous with sharing and inspiring great ideas. Coming off our centenary celebration where we unveiled the Next100 Fund idea, we truly believe that great ideas and collaboration are key to moving Nigeria forward. We hope that the event unearths new ideas and stories that will help us build better communities around us.” The ticketed event would take place in Lagos and was expected to draw members of the TEDxLagos and international TED communities as well as thought leaders across various sectors. “Union Bank’s partnership reiterates its continued commitment to innovation, creativity and support for Nigeria’s growth. The bank recently released the second edition of its citizenship, sustainability and innovation (CSI) report, a compendium which outlines the impact Union Bank has made within its host communities and its commitment to its customers and other stakeholders. “It also emphasises the bank’s vision to inspire a future where private sector participants are committed drivers of the nation’s sustainable development,” the statement added.
