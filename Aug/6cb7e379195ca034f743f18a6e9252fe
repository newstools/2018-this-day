”I’m here to learn, I’m here to play games and I’m here to improve. I want to make the fans happy this year.
I had some good years under Jody at Chelsea. We won the FA Youth Cup a few times, the youth Champions League, but overall, he’s just a good guy.” The former Chelsea Academy Player of the Year has played nonstop at Chelsea for more than eleven years, though he has enjoyed loan spells at Brighton and Hull City.
