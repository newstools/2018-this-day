By David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka A media aide to the Anambra State Governor, Chief Willie Obiano, Mr. Randie Chima, has been reported dead. Chima who was Senior Special Assistant to Obiano on Television Documentary, was found dead in his room at Nwakpodulu Avenue, Awka, the Anambra State capital.
Chima, a media personality it was gathered, was last seen on Friday evening “hale and hearty”, where he shared drinks with friends before retiring for the day. “I’m surprised to hear this story. That Randie is dead? We were together on Friday. He was hale and hearty. A good man is gone. Randie exercised almost regularly at Ekwueme Square,” a source who pleaded anonymity, said.
His neighbours had suspected that something was wrong when they could not see him throughout Saturday, causing them to force open his room, only to find his dead body lying on the bed.
The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Haruna Mohammed confirmed the story to our correspondent yesterday. He said, “There was a report at B Division, Awka that one Randie Chima aged 57 years of Nwakpodulu Avenue and SSA to Anambra State Governor on Audio Visual Productions slept the previous night and did not open his door the next day.
“When the door was eventually forced open, after several knocks by his neighbours, his lifeless body was found lying on the bed.
