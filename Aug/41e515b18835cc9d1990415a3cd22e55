As the United Arab Emirates (UAE) celebrates the second Emirati Women’s Day, Fahad Obaid Mohammed Altaffag, its Ambassador to Nigeria, has tasked women on dedication and preservation of family values. Altaffag said on Tuesday in Abuja that women across the world possess the capacity to maintain good family values and the nation at large. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that Emirati Women’s Day was launched in 2015 by Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak. Mubarak is the Chairperson of the General Women’s Union, President of the Family Development Foundation and the Supreme Council for Motherhood and Childhood.
