The campaign organisation of Anamero Dekeri, an Edo North senatorial aspirant has said described the rumoured automatic ticket to the Senate Deputy Chief Whip, Francis Alimikhena, as an attempt to smear the image of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Party, Adams Oshiomhole. Dekeri and the serving senator for the senatorial district-Alimikhena are the major contenders for the All Progressives Congress ticket for Edo North, which is Oshiomhole’s senatorial district. The Director General of the Anamero Dekeri for Senate Campaign Organisation, Mr. Peter Oba, said the speculation does not reflect Oshiomhole’s assurance that the process will be transparent, democratic and fair. The group called on Dekeri’s supporters to disregard the rumoured automatic ticket as the party leaders had opted for a democratic process. It insisted that Dekeri would not be discouraged by falsehood and propaganda orchestrated by its opponents. The statement said, “The attempt to deceive the strong support base of Dekeri is dead on arrival. It is ridiculous that at a time when the leadership of our great party is striving to clear the mess created by serial betrayals, those responsible for the mess are coming up with an automatic ticket charade in order to cause more trouble for the party. “We hereby state clearly that this is nothing but a calculated attempt to smear the image Oshiomhole. The people of Edo North Senatorial District will not fold their arms and watch the respected leader’s name dragged to the mud.” The group argued that Oshiomhole, “is a democrat who leads by example.” Hence, it noted, the former labour leader could not be involved in any undemocratic game. “The automatic talk is a ruse. And no individual, especially from Edo North, will be allowed to drag his name to disrepute under any guise. We advise Alimikhena campaign team to stop spreading falsehood capable of causing any confusion in the party.”
