In a landmark demonstration of the benefits of pension reforms in Edo State, the state Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has disbursed N7.3233 million to four next of kin of two deceased enrollees in the state contributory pension scheme. The beneficiaries are Oriomon Morrison, Oriomon Emuata, Osahenrunmwen Iyawe and Patience Iyawe, who received the money as benefits under the Group Life Assurance scheme. Presenting the cheque at the Government House in Benin-city, the state capital, Obaseki said the presentation of cheque to the next of kin to the deceased civil servants with the state civil service commission is an achievement recorded by this administration According to him, “When this government came to power, I promised that we would not leave the pension scheme the way we met it. Then, we assured the Edo people that all issues relating to pension are going to be resolved. “Those who do not believe that our government is working will now know that we mean well for our people and those who served the state.” On the pension scheme, Obaseki further assured workers, who are in active service that they have nothing to worry about regarding their pension, noting that his government has put measures in place to settle pension benefits after service. The Head of Service, Mrs. Gladys Idahor, expressed appreciation to the governor for initiating the contributory pension scheme in the state, adding that with the scheme in place, pensioners will have no reason to protest in demand for their money. Idahor explained that a provision under the contributory pension scheme requires that aside next of kin receiving pension, they are also entitled to three times the annual salary prior to death.
