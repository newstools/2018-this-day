Music star, Timaya, recently told co-musician Phyno to forget about marriage as it doesn’t work, rather he should get a child outside wedlock. This was after Timaya took to his Instagram page to announce that he would like to take a back seat when it comes to baby making, given his three kids from two women. In the viral video Phyno shared on his Insta-story, Timaya who spoke on Pidgin said: : “Just born pikin, pikin go grow, this marriage thing no dey work”, which loosely translated means, ‘Just give birth to children and watch them grow, marriage doesn’t work’.
