Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano The Kano State Deputy Governor, Prof. Hafiz Abubaka has denied the report that he defected from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “I have not resigned; I am still the deputy governor of Kano State. I am currently in Abuja attending an official function; that is, the National Council of Education meeting,” he said. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, Abubakar debunked the report, adding that he is still the deputy governor of Kano State. The purported defection of the deputy governor was announced on the PDP twitter handle welcoming him and the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, who defected on Wednesday. Abubakar added that he would take decision on his political future at an appropriate time, after consultations. “I will take decision on my political future at an appropriate time after due consultation with my political leaders,” he added. He therefore blamed “some agents” of the state government for spreading the rumour.
