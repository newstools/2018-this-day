The national women’s senior team, the D’Tigress, failed to arrive Lagos yesterday from the United States of America to continue the build up to the FIBA 2018 World Cup due to logistic reasons. According to an earlier schedule released by the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF), D’Tigress who are currently in Atlanta, USA, were to arrive Lagos on Tuesday night but flight cancellations forced the stay back. NBBF Board Member, Col. Sam Ahmedu (rtd) who is with the team said, “There are no suitable flights as their travel plans are being done all the way to Spain for ease of movement of the players.” Since the team’s movement is hinged on availability of flight, Ahmedu admitted that no date has been fixed for the team’s arrival in Lagos for now. “We are aware that a lot of people are eager to see the team train back home, but the continued delay is nobody’s fault,” Ahmedu continued. He assured basketball stakeholders that the delay will in no way affect the team’s training as the Coach Otis Hughley-led technical crew have continued with their training sessions as they await the next directive. The current African champion will tip off their World Cup campaign against Australia on Saturday, September 22 at the Arena Santiago Martin, San Cristobal De La Laguna, Spain.
