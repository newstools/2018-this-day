From George Okoh on Makurdi The Benue State Government can now access its accounts with various banks where its funds are kept following the unfreezing of its account by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) on Thursday. According to the Press Secretary to the governor, Mr Terver Akase, the state government got to know that its accounts had been unfrozen when it got calls from the banks that the state could now transact business. He said there was no document served on the government by the EFCC to show that the accounts were frozen or unfrozen but added that on both occasions they were informed by the banks. Akase alleged that the federal government and its agencies launched a witch hunt on the state governor over his defection from the All Progressive Congress(APC) “As I speak to you several moves are being made to embarrass and intimidate the governor but this move will not work as governor Ortom led government remain transparent and clean and will not fall to any intimidation,” he said. He said the state government welcomed the probe by the EFCC of its security vote account which he advocated should be done without impunity. The governor’s spokesman also challenged the EFCC to extend its probe of security spending to the presidency and other states.
He called for the investigation of the financial spendings of special military operation led by the Nigerian army. Meanwhile the Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom has appreciated Nigerians for their solidarity, support and prayers which enabled the nation as well as Benue State to overcome the recent wave of impunity. He said the development had deepened democracy which thrives on the rule of law and due process. The governor said that the nationwide condemnation which trailed the Police and DSS siege to the Benue State House of Assembly as well as the invasion of the National Assembly will be remembered and appreciated by patriots now and in the future.
