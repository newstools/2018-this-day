The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has confirmed that seven deaths have been recorded from the outbreak of cholera in four communities in the territory. The affected communities are Kubwa, Sauka, Mpape and Ushafa. The Director of Public Health in the Health and Human Services Secretariat, FCTA, Dr. Humphrey Okoroukwu, gave the confirmation on the outbreak Monday to the News Agency of Nigeria in Abuja. Dr Okoroukwu said two deaths were recorded at Kubwa village, one at Sauka, two deaths at Mpape and two at Ushafa. The cholera outbreak was also reported at Kwali and Kuje Area Councils. However, according to Okoroukwu, the outbreak in the two councils did not claim any life. He stressed that authority had brought the situation in the two area councils and those at Sauka, Mpape and Kubwa villages under control. He said the outbreak at Ushafa was the most recent, adding all efforts had been put in place by the administration to address it. The director also disclosed that there were 58 cases listed in the recent outbreak at Ushafa, comprising 36 females and 22 males. He emphasised that only two deaths were recorded at Ushafa and refuted speculations of five deaths from the disease in the community. Okoroukwu noted that the cases had symptoms of cholera, while laboratory confirmation was being awaited. The director said, however, that a case of cholera had been established from the laboratory tests conducted on one of the patients. “We are treating them as cholera, so that we won’t take any chances, and our disease surveillance officers in Bwari Area Council are all on ground in Ushafa to curtail it. “We have since sent some medications to Bwari General Hospital as well as chlorine and water guard for the treatment of their drinkable water,” he said. Okoroukwu noted that health education had been intensified in communities to sensitise residents on the prevention and management of the disease.
