Iyobosa Uwugiaren in Abuja Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, has appealed to the Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), manufacturer of the A-29 Super Tucano attack aircraft, to accelerate action on the delivery of the aircraft to Nigeria to enhance operational capability of the Air Force in the on-going war against Boko Haram. The Director of Public Relations and Information, Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, said the CAS made the request weekend while receiving a delegation from the company at NAF Headquarters, Abuja. The visiting delegation, which also included officials from the Office of Security Cooperation (OSC) of the United States Embassy in Nigeria, was led by Senior Vice President of SNC, Mr Taco Gilbert, who assured the CAS of the company’s determination to deliver quality aircraft capable of providing the needed impetus for NAF’s operations. He also expressed the commitment of the company to provide adequate training for NAF’s air and ground crew to ensure effective and efficient operation of the aircraft. In addition, the SNC Vice President noted that the company looked forward to continued collaboration with NAF towards building a new air capability to address security challenges in the country. While responding, Abubakar, according to the statement, expressed his delight at the US government’s support for the fight against insurgency with the signing of the contract to sell the Super Tucano aircraft to Nigeria. He noted, however, that the major concern of the NAF was the timeframe for delivery, while expressing confidence that the counterinsurgency operations in the Northeast could be executed more effectively, if light attack aircraft like the Super Tucano, with its long range, precision munitions as well as day and night capability, could be made available to the NAF in good time. The Airforce chief therefore urged the company to expedite production so that at least two of the aircraft would be available to Nigeria within an earlier timeframe, to boost counterinsurgency operations. One of the highlights of the visit was the presentation of a model of the Super Tucano aircraft to the CAS.
