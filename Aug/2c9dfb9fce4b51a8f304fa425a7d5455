By Kunle Adewale Japan yesterday evening defeated Spain 3-1 to win their first-ever FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup crown in Vannes to ensure the trophy remains in Asia after Korea DPR won the title two years ago in Papua New Guinea.
Despite being on the back foot for most of the half, Japan stunned La Rojita by taking the lead against the run of play on the 38th minute. Having shown a desire to shoot from distance, as she did in hitting the crossbar against England in the semi-finals, Hinata Miyazawa found the target this time with her right foot, leaving the outstretched Catalina Coll with little chance to make the save. Taking the lead inspired the East Asians to push forward, and only a fine point-blank save from Coll denied the Japanese a second goal before the break through Jun Endo.
On 57th minute, Saori Takarada doubled Japan’s lead with an assured finish after being connected score by a neat Riko Ueki flicked pass, with her back to goal.
Having claimed control of the contest, the Japanese looked more confident with their play. That best summed up their third goal on 65th minute. Takarada turned supplier for Fuka Nagano on the right of the Spain box. Her superb first-time shot flew over Coll and into the net. There was a reply from Pedro Lopez’s side, however after Candela Andujar pulled a goal back on 71st minute, but that was as far as the Spanish comeback efforts would reach, as Japan added to last year’s Asian U-19 title with a maiden world crown in this age category.
In the third place game, England beat hosts France 4-2 in a penalty shootout to win bronze for the first time at the Women’s Under-20 World Cup after both sides played 1-1 at full time
