By Mohammed Aminu in Sokoto A former Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Sokoto State, Alhaji Abubakar Shehu Tambuwal, has defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) with 10,000 supporters in Tambuwal Local Government Area (LGA) of the state. Addressing party supporters in the LGA yesterday, Tambuwal said his decision to join the APC was borne out of his quest to join hands with the progressives so as to move the state to the next level.
He posited that his political associates convinced him to join the APC, stressing that he had no other option than to hearken to their yearnings and aspirations.
Tambuwal, who was also a former Commissioner of Education in Sokoto State, accused Governor Aminu Tambuwal of neglecting his political associates.
He alleged that Tambuwal betrayed him, after he assisted him (the governor) in his political career. According to him, Governor Tambuwal was in the House of Representatives for 12 years and performed below expectations in terms of attracting constituency projects that could enhance the wellbeing of his people.
“As you are aware, during his stint as Speaker of the House of Representatives and now as the governor ,APC had no party office in Tambuwal LGA. In fact, meetings were usually done at residences of party officials,” he stated.
In his remarks, the state Chairman of the APC, Alhaji Isa Sadiq Achida,  who presented the party membership card to Tambuwal, pledged to ensure a level playing ground for the new members. Achida stressed that the people of the state are solidly behind President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election bid in 2019.
Also speaking, the APC Chairman in Tambuwal LGA, Alhaji Umaru Maitafsir, described the APC as the party to beat in the council.
He added that Tambuwal defected to the0 APC  with no fewer than 100, 000 people from Yabo, Kebbi, Tureta, Dange/Shuni, Bodinga and Shagari LGAs of the state.
