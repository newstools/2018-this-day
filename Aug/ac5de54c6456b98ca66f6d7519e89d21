Segun James An Ikeja High Court yesterday dismissed the murder charge filed against the Lagos State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Moshood Salvador, following the alleged murder of the Apapa Local Government Area chairman of the party, Mr. Adeniyi Aborishade, after a party meeting. The police were said to have arrested 11 PDP members, including the chairman who had gone to report the incident. Following his arrest, Salvador and the other 10 accused persons were subsequently arraignment before a Yaba Chief Magistrate Court which remanded them in Kirikiri Prisons on a two-count charge of conspiracy and unlawful killing on July 25. During yesterday’s proceedings, the vacation judge, Justice Obafemi Adamson, dismissed the charge after entertaining submissions from counsels in a counter suit challenging the charge filed by Salvador against the state. Justice Adamson in the ruling said that in view of the advice from the office of the Directorate of Public Prosecution, which exonerated the PDP chairman from the murder charge, Salvador should be released from the Kirikiri Prison. Earlier, Mr. Olaitan Soetan, an Assistant Director from the DPP had informed the court that there was a new “development regarding” Salvador’s prayers in the counter suit. Mr. Lawal Pedro, Salvador’s defence counsel, also told the court: “The matter has been overtaken by circumstances.” Aborishade was allegedly murdered on July 21, during a meeting of the PDP that held at Igbosuku Village, Eti-Osa LGA of the state.
