THISDAY columnist, Mr. Reno Omokri, will next week deliver a TEDx Talk on restructuring. Tagged TEDxApata, the talk will take place in Ibadan and tickets are already on sale on the TED website. An advocate of restructuring, Omokri was one of the aides of former President Jonathan who supported the convocation of the 2014 National Conference. Omokri is also a bestselling author and has written about the urgent need to restructure Nigeria along the lines of meritocracy and true federalism. THISDAY has taken an exclusive look at the promo for the talk in which Omokri makes the following assertions: We need to make Nigeria work for Nigerians otherwise Nigerians may end up walking out of Nigeria. Now we are seeing this already. Every year, literally hundreds of thousands of Nigerians try to make it to Europe, some on foot, through the Sahara Desert, and the Mediterranean Sea. Hundreds, maybe thousands die in the process. Others become slaves in Libya. This is happening because Nigeria, as presently constituted, is the hardest place to succeed. We can’t run away from restructuring. Nigeria is not working for Nigerians. Nigerians are intelligent people, but Nigeria is not an intelligent country. An unintelligent country can’t provide the enabling environment for intelligent people. Nigeria is never going to move from being a consumer nation to being a prosumer one if we do not restructure. A prosumer is a person who consumes what he produces. A consumer is s person who consumes what others produce. It is very hard, in fact almost impossible, for a nation to become wealthy, if she only consumes. We need a paradigm shift from consumption to prosumption. Now, prosumer is a word that exists, but prosumption is a word I made up to explain the act of consuming your product.
