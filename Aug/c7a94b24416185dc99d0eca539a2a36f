Yussuff who is representing Osogbo/Olorunda/Orolu/Irepodun Federal Constituency at the lower chamber, spoke with Journalists in Osogbo,  the Osun state capital, at the weekend. He also cleared the air on the insinuation in some quarters that he was planning to leave APC, saying “as far as I am concerned, I am still in APC and I am not planning to leave the progressive party”. He restated his readiness to support the party and ensure its victory in the September 22 governorship election in the state. He said, “”irrespective of what happened, we are going to work for the party. Reacting to the circumstances that surrounded the primary election of the party, he said he was not aware of any appeal committee, adding “nobody has reached out to me as party after the primary”. He said, “we are in the position to support the APC and not about the candidate. I thank all my supporters who stood despite the persecution during and after the primary. We would do our best to ensure that APC win the coming election in this state. “Nigerians should be aware that a lot of party chieftains are being alienated today. I’m not guaranteeing any party. But, we hope that party member will put what happened in the primary behind and work for the victory of the party,” he said. Asked why he has not officially congratulated the party’s gubernatorial candidate, Gboyega Oyetola, he said “I am not in the position to congratulate anybody”. “When I became Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, nobody in the party or government congratulated me,” he added.
