The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has lost one of its National Executive Committee (NEC) and the only National Officer from Kwara State, Hon. Ahmed Yinka Aluko, to the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC). Aluko, who was the party’s flag bearer as deputy governorship candidate in the 2015 elections resigned his elective position and membership of the PDP during the party’s NEC meeting Thursday. The former Special Adviser on Security matters in Kwara State accused the opposition of impunity and undemocratic practices. Aluko said he was irked by the decision of the PDP’s national leadership to hand over the structure of the party to the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, who defected to PDP on Tuesday and attended its NEC meeting yesterday. “It is therefore, shocking that the party at the national level has resolved to hand over the party structures and all electable positions to defectors without any regards for those who stood by the party and built it Into a strong winning machine in Kwara. It is even more shocking that as the only national officer from kwara State and NEC member from Kwara was not consulted,” he added. Aluko said he was leaving PDP “ for a more democratic platform.”
