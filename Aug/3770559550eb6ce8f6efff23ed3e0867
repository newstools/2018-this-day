U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will visit North Korea again next week to try to persuade the country to abandon its nuclear weapons, and will take a new U.S. special representative, Stephen Biegun, with him in an attempt to break the deadlock, according to Reuters. Pompeo on Thursday named the Ford Motor Co executive, a veteran Republican foreign policy hand, as the U.S. special envoy to North Korea. “Steve will direct U.S. policy towards North Korea and lead our efforts to achieve President Trump’s goal of the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea as agreed to by Kim Jong Un,” Pompeo told reporters. “He and I will be traveling to North Korea next week to make further diplomatic progress towards our objective.”
