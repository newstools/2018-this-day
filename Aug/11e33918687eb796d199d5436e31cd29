By Segun Awofadeji in Gombe A top All Progressive Congress (APC) Governorship hopeful in Gombe State, Alhaji Farouk Bamusa, has given N40 million to the executives of the party at all levels in the state. Bamusa, while giving out the cash at the party Secretariat recently, said it was part of his own contribution towards supporting the party officials to celebrate Eid-el-Kabir. According to him, APC as an opposition party in the state has many challenges, especially lack of financial resources, as such, the expectations and needs of their followers and loyalists may not be fully met by the officials. He said he would continue to be loyal to the party and support it in whatever way possible. Bamusa also called on the party delegates to give him the mandate to fly the party’s flag in the governorship election saying, “the party needs a performer and I am the only candidate that can wrestle power from the PDP in Gombe State with your support. Give me the chance and I will not disappoint you”. Responding, the state chairman, Mr. Nitte Amangal, commended the aspirant and said the party was very much aware of his activities in supporting the party. A breakdown of the cash distribution shows that the 30 state executives will each have N50,000.00; the state chairman N100,000.00; party secretariat administrative staff N50,000.00; youths present at the occasion N50,000.00; the 297 LG chairmen in the eleven LGAs N20,000.00 each; and ward chairmen and all ward executives also got various sums all totaling N40 million.
