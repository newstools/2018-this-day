Neymar came on as a late substitute for Paris St-Germain as his side beat Monaco 4-0 in the French Super Cup. The match in China was the Brazilian’s first game since the World Cup and first for PSG since February, when he suffered a foot injury. Neymar came on after 75 minutes in a game where Angel Di Maria scored twice while Christopher Nkunku and Timothy Weah got the other PSG goals. In front of a 41,237 crowd at the stadium in Shenzhen, Argentine Di Maria broke the deadlock with a free-kick after 32 minutes before Nkunku and Weah – the son of ex-PSG and AC Milan forward and Liberia president George – struck. PSG’s new manager Thomas Tuchel then brought on Neymar before Di Maria scored in injury time to seal a dominant victory and give the league champions their eighth French Super Cup win.
