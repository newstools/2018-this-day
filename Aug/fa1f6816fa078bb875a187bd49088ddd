Stories by Nseobong Okon-Ekong Mrs. Ify Morah, an aspirant to the House of Representatives on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has outlined some of the issues plaguing the people of Oyi/Ayamelum federal constituency in Anambra State. Morah, a lawyer and investor in the oil and gas trade said a few of the challenges which she will face in the first phase of her legislative mandate include security, reduction of hunger and peace. According to her will tackle these issues by empowering the youths of Oyi/Ayamelum yearly to ensure that their values are optimised and their dreams assume a wider horizon, instead of wasting precious time in consumption of alcohol. The PDP aspirant’s human capital development and empowerment agenda will accommodate youths, women and men. Campaigning under the broad theme, ‘Restoration 2019’, Morah was described by her team leader, Mr. Sunny St. Clement as “a virtuous woman who knows the challenges facing her children in an ever dynamic world of today. She is a mother whose heart desires to see her people emerge victorious in life. I see a woman who is genuinely willing and ready to serve Oyi/Ayamelum Constituency in the Green Chamber.” Demonstrating her willingness to work with other stakeholders, Morah called on friends and indigenes of Oyi/Ayamelum Constituency to suggest what must be done to alleviate the prevailing sufferings of the people. Married to a successful businessman, their union is blessed with five children. She is also very successful forex trader. St. Clement further praised her as “a fearless woman, but calculative in risk taking. Over the years she has lived with the burden to service the people in truth. Left for her, she would have no reason to join politics because she has more than enough. She is not going to the House of Representatives to enrich herself, but to ensure that the elusive dividends of democracy are brought home to the people.”
