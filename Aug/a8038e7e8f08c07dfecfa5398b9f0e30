The NOIPolls Personal Well-Being Index (PWBI) report for the second quarter of 2018, recorded a minimal increase of 0.4 points to 65.2 points last quarter, compared with the 64.8 points it was in the first quarter of 2018. The magnitude of the positive perception of the various aspects of one’s life, altogether, is determined by the PWBI. According to the poll, four out of the seven factors that constitute the PWBI experienced an increase while the remaining three experienced a decrease. “The highest increase, as usual, was seen in the Religion Index with a 1.2-point increase to stand at 90.3-points from the 89.1-points obtained in Q1, 2018. “Interestingly, the Economic Index also increased, though minimally, to 42-points in Q2, 2018 from 41.8-points of Q1, 2018, indicating a 0.2-point difference. “This slight increase corroborates the report by the federal government that Nigeria’s economic outlook for 2018 and over the medium term witnessed an upward trend. “This win, according to the Ministry of Budget and National Planning was achieved as a result of series of short term interventions aimed at reflating the economy. “Economist and stakeholders in the ministry have also attributed the country’s growth acceleration to improved oil prices, revenue, production, and the recently introduced foreign exchange measures that contributed to better foreign exchange availability. On the contrary, the Personal Security Index saw the highest decline of 1.1-point to stand at 63.5-points in Q2, 2018 from 64.6-points obtained in Q1, 2018.
