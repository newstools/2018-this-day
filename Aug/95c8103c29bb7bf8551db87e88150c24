A fruit, it is said, does not fall too far from its tree. Zina Anumudu, the daughter of fashion enthusiast, Nkiru Anumudu, is a chip off the old block. The young lady, who is in her early 20s, has no doubt been bitten by the bug of her mother’s love of fashion. Dark-complexioned and pretty, Zina was sighted at an event in Lagos recently dressed to the nines. She flaunted a beautiful outfit that put her great physique on display. Nkiru remains one of Nigeria’s most expensively dressed women. She and Zina have graced a number of red carpet events in company of each other and the younger Anumudu has received accolades for her exquisite style.
