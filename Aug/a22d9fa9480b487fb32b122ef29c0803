Nseobong Okon-Ekong An aspirant for the Oshimili North constituency in the Delta State House of Assembly, Mr. Joseph Adimabuah Okonmah has lamented over the marginilisation of Illah and other communities in the area by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government in the state. Okonmah who is a lawyer and public relations practitioner spoke at a rally, he emphasised the need to deliver the constituency to the All Progressives Congress (APC) as the only way out of the deprivation suffered by the people of Oshimili North. According to Okonmah, “Our people have been so brazenly neglected. It is very glaring,. There is basically no development in Illah or evidence of state government’s presence in these communities. There is no electricity for over four years, not to talk of pipe borne water or good road network. We are in this race for service and quality leadership. There must be a difference between well -groomed leaders and accidental politicians. We must begin to engage our people to see how we can enthrone true democracy with evident dividends that can address poverty, hopelessness, high rate of unemployment, and underdevelopment of our communities and provide basic needs for the healthy living of our people.” Present at the rally were leading officials of the APC in Delta State and other dignitaries including APC Delta North Senatorial hopeful, Dr. Marian Nneamaka Alli, Precious Enus, Dr. Ken Mordi, Mr. Emmanuel Obanya and Mr. Ike Gwam. Challenging other contenders for the office to debate, Okonmah said, “Any person from this constituency who can truly attest to adequate representation that is anchored on positive development to face the reality by demanding a change of government and representation.”
