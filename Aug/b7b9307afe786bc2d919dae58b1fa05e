The governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Gombe State, Muhammad Jibrin Barde, has saluted Muslims in the state on the occasion of the 2018 Eid el Kabir celebrations. In a goodwill message by his media team, Dan Barde stated that only love and sacrificial living will contribute to building a stronger and more economically and socially prosperous state and Nigeria. He urged Muslims to follow the examples already laid down by the Holy Prophet as a means of ensuring the enthronement of peaceful coexistence in Gombe State. “Eid el Kabir is a celebration of obedience, love and the supremacy of God. I have always said that the unity and survival is dependent on how much love we are all willing to share with those around us, especially the poor and vulnerable and also with those who do not share in our own religious beliefs”. Barde also used the opportunity to commiserate with those who lost their lives in the flood that consumed Ayaba in Billiri and Cham in Balanga Local Government Areas of the state. He prayed for the repose of their souls.
