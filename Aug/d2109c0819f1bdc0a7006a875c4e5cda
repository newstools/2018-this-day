Dr (Mrs.) Helen Naomi Godswill Solomon, a lawyer, is the author of ‘The Birth of a New Nigeria’. In the book, she showcases the greatness of Nigeria and calls on all to work towards making the country great again. Those who have read the book say it offers an insight into what Solomon, as an individual, will do if she is in the position of power. Perhaps, this explains why she has joined the murky waters of politics in Nigeria. Obviously desirous of changing the current narratives in the land, she dared the odds and took a bold step to live her dream on July 13, when she declared her intention to run for president on the platform of the Peoples Redemption Party, PRP, in 2019. Prior to her declaration, Solomon had impacted many lives through her “Operation Deborah Arise” (ODA), an international, non-governmental organisation specialising in raising women from thrash to treasure. In her capacity, she goes from one nation to another, rehabilitating African prostitutes, stopping child trafficking and the use of young girls as sex slaves, feeding the poor in various cities and mentoring, empowering and helping women and young girls to use their God-given talents to build homes, businesses and nations. Solomon, also the co-founder and president of Divine Empowerment and Leadership Foundation for Youths and Women, graduated from the Nigerian Law School in 1992. She was ordained a minister in the Redeemed Christian Church of God in 2000.
