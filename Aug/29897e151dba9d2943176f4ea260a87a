By Kayode Fasua All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain and former governorship aspirant in Ekiti State, Engr. Kayode Ojo, has deplored the killing of former Governor Segun Oni`s Personal Assistant and APC chieftain, Bunmi Ojo, who was shot by unknown gunmen last week in Ado-Ekiti. In a statement by his spokesman, Mr Deji Aiyelabowo, he expressed shock over the dastardly act and commiserated with the family of the deceased and the entire APC family. According to him, it was sad and disheartening to hear about the “unwarranted termination of the life of the harmless, progressive and promising Ekiti son.” He stated that he learnt with rude shock and disbelief, the murder of Ojo “at a time when all the progressives are pulling resources together to restore the lost glory of Ekiti State. “ Worried by the current security situation in the state, particularly the assassination of prominent members of the APC in the state in recent time, Ojo called on security agencies to find a lasting solution to the worrisome and scary situation by ensuring that the perpetrators of the dastardly acts are fished out and brought to book. He said the APC and the entire Ekiti people have lost one of their virtuous sons, urging his associates to keep his good legacies so as to sustain his good memories. He beseeched God to grant him eternal rest, and grant the family, friends and the entire APC family, the fortitude to bear the painful exit. The late Bunmi Ojo, who was a board member of the Federal Character Commission, was watching a football match with other soccer fans at a viewing centre around Adebayo area of Ado -Ekiti when assailants opened fire on him last week.
