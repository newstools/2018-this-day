George Okoh in Makurdi A presidential aspirant on the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) platform in the 2019 presidential election, Alhaji Sule Lamido, has alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration has divided Nigeria, and called on Nigerians to reject the divisive manipulation by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to hang on to power. He said the APC-led government has continuously divided Nigerians on ethnic and religious fault line that has never been seen in the country even as he called on the electorate to vote out the APC before they destroy the country completely. Lamido made the call in Makurdi, the Benue State capital, when he visited the state government to declare his intention to run for the presidency of the country. He said the APC runs its platform based on self declaration of “Mr. Integrity” by its leader, President Buhari, stressing that the high level of corruption under this regime is mind-boggling. “Buhari claims to be the only man with integrity in the country while he vilified every other person as corrupt This is not true, and Nigerians will be shocked on the level of corruption by the APC when they are voted out in 2019,” he added. He argued that the PDP is the only party that can bring unity and oneness to the country. The former governor of Jigawa State explained that he is in the race to save Nigeria from collapse due to the poor handling by the APC. “Once you are in the PDP you are a criminal that shouldn’t be dinned with but when such person crosses over to APC he becomes a saint,” Lamido added. Lamido also berated the Buhari-led administration for the spate of killings all over the country.
