You never let a crisis go to waste! Nothing sums up the world of Amaka Chika-Mbonu like this opening opener. Amaka could have chosen to wallow in self-pity and defeat after going through a harrowing matrimonial experience in the hands of a husband whose lecherous desires were untamable that he fathered two kids from a woman who was married to his protégé and whose marriage certificate he signed as their pastor. That experience had the tendency to send Amaka to her early grave or tamper with her mental health. But no, she has chosen a novel way to vent her hurt by making it a healing balm to many homes and marriages. Amaka, who is a Christian marriage counsellor of 15 years, has since recovered from the shock, and come out with her second book, ‘49 Ways To Get Rid of The Other Woman (Without Getting Caught)’. The book probably was inspired by her unpalatable experience. This book seems to have direct reference to what had occurred to her or what she had experienced in the past. Her other book which was launched last year titled: How to get your wife to swing from the chandelier in a red negligee, a book said to be for couples, but written from biblical perspective. Amaka, a supremely gorgeous and stylish lady who once lived in a very sweet and near-perfect world that was shattered by the unbelievable scandal, became a subject of public sympathy in 2010 when her husband, pastor, and former Managing Director of Citizens Bank and later Assurance Bank, Amaka Mbonu, was caught in an adulterous scandal that was exposed through DNA test. The cheating woman, Doreen, happened to thebewife of his protégé, Henry, both of whom looked up to Mbonu as their mentor and pastor.
