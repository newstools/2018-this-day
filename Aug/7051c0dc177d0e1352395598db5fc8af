The clerk of the National Assembly, Mr. Sani Omolori, was Tuesday morning prevented from entering the National Assembly premises by operatives of the Department of State Services.  The National Assembly clerk was seen at the gate of the National Assembly making phone calls, apparently to seek intervention of relevant quarters.  The DSS operatives who sealed off the entrance to the National Assembly had arrived as early as 6.55am Â to prevent lawmakers, journalists and staff of the National Assembly from gaining access to the premises.  Some of the lawmakers were later allowed to enter the premises.
