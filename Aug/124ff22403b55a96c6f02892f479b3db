The second franchise of the blockbuster, Equalizer, officially drops today in cinemas across Nigeria. The much anticipated ‘Equalizer’ is back to the cinemas as Hollywood’s A-list actor Denzel Washington (Robert McCall) returns to screen as the saviour of the oppressed and downtrodden. Denzel’s handling of the character of McCall is natural and on point as he switches between being a regular guy driving a car for a living and a sophisticated Special Forces agent. This reveals the amount of research that goes into Denzel’s understanding and portrayal of the character. Directed by Antoine Fuqua, The Equalizer 2 is a sequel to 2014 film The Equalizer. The film stars Denzel Washington, Pedro Pascal, Ashton Sanders, Melissa Leo, and Bill Pullman. It is distributed in Nigeria by Silverbird Film Distribution. The idea of Equalizer is central to this franchise.
