By Obinna Chima The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday injected $327,440,499.50 into the interbank market through Retail Secondary Market Intervention Sales (SMIS). This was in addition to the sale of CNY 69,707,333.39 in the spot and short-tenored forwards. The figures obtained from the CBN showed that the US dollar-denominated interventions were only for concerns in the agricultural and raw materials sectors. The acting Director, Corporate Communications, CBN, Mr. Isaac Okorafor, said the exercise which was in tune with the CBN guidelines, were for the payment of Renminbi denominated Letters of Credit for agriculture as well as raw materials. He added that the sales in the Chinese Yuan were through a combination of spot and short-tenored forwards, arising from bids received from authorised dealers. While noting that availability of Renminbi was sure to ease pressure on the Nigerian foreign exchange market, Okorafor attributed the relative stability in the foreign exchange market to the intervention of the CBN as well as the sustained increase in crude oil prices in the international market. He further assured that the CBN would remain committed to ensuring that all the sectors continue to enjoy access to the needed foreign exchange by Nigerians. Meanwhile, the dollar exchanged for N360 at the Bureau de Change (BDC) segment of the foreign exchange market, while CNY 1 exchanged for N53.35.
