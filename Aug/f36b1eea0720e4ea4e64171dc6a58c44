Former Senate Minority Leader, Godswill Akpabio, has revealed that the style of fighting corruption and poverty in the All Progressives Congress (APC), attracted him to the party. Describing the two as twins, Akpabio, after an APC caucus meeting late Tuesday night, praised President Muhammadu Buhari’s leadership style in tackling corruption and poverty. “The first thing you need to know about the APC, from the point of view of leadership, I am quite impressed. The president has kept his integrity intact. He has been able to improve the image of Nigeria and restore a lot of respect to Nigeria from the international community. I can assure you that he alone can attract millions of people, he is that infectious. Of course his stance on corruption and that Nigerians have food on their table is something is applauded all over the world. I have also advocated that he also fights the twin brother of corruption, that is poverty. “I am joining the APC as a government to stabilise the government and to assist the government to create employment opportunities for Nigerians so that we can fight the twin brother to corruption, which is poverty. Poverty creates corruption and corruption deepens poverty, so we need to fight the two together. And that is one of the things I find attractive with the APC and believe me with my people in Akwa Ibom State, with my presence in the APC my people in South South have now seen the light and they say APC is the party to vote for come 2019.” On what was discussed, Akpabio said the meeting deliberated on topical issues in the interest of the country.
“The meeting went very well and a lot of topical issues were discussed bothering on the interests of the Nation. The resolutions are fantastic and I believe that resolutions will not only move the party forward but will help to alleviate the situation in the country today and Nigerians will be happy for it.”
Akpabio left the opposition party, PDP, to join the ruling APC last month.
