 Chelsea opened their Premier League campaign with victory against Huddersfield, while Tottenham, Bournemouth, Crystal Palace and Watford also made winning starts.

In the day’s late kick-off, Wolves twice came from behind to draw 2-2 at home with Everton. New £50m signing Richarlison scored twice on his debut, while Phil Jagielka was sent off five minutes before half-time. In the early start, England’s World Cup stars Harry Kane and Dele Alli started against Newcastle in Tottenham’s 2-1 victory at St James’ Park. Spurs needed goalline technology for their opener, as replays showed Jan Vertonghen’s header had crossed the line by 9mm. Joselu equalised for the Magpies, before Alli headed in the winner in the 18th minute. Roberto Pereyra scored twice, including a stunning volley, as Watford beat Brighton 2-0.  Fulham’s return to the top flight ended in defeat as Jeffrey Schlupp and Wilfried Zaha gave Crystal Palace a 2-0 win at Craven Cottage, while fellow new boys Cardiff lost 2-0 to Bournemouth after goals from Ryan Fraser and Callum Wilson.
