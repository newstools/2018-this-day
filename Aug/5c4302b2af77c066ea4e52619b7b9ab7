Other aspirants are Alhaji Oseni Yakubu, for Kogi Central, and Alhaji Jibrin Isah Echocho for Kogi East.
Also the governor has endorsed Asuku Bello, the son of retired Justice Moses Bello for House of Representatives. Asuku Bello is expected to represent Adavi-Okehi federal constituency in the forthcoming House of Representatives election.
The governor who was speaking at the coronation ceremony of the newly-appointed Ohi of Adavi, Alhaji Muhammed Ireyi Bello, advised other aspirants to abide by this arrangement to make way for peace, saying that everyone has a place in his government. He called on politicians in the state to play the game peacefully and eschew violence and rancour.
He said as the first step towards achieving this, he has instituted a mechanism within the APC, to ensure that the primaries of the party are conducted without rancour. The governor who was represented by his Special Adviser, on Sustainable Development Goals, (SDG), Mumuni Okara, said similar arrangements has also been put in place in other elective positions across the state. “What we have done is to reduce tension and create an enabling environment for all. It is not everybody that can occupy the position. It is just one. I assured all other contestants to be patient as there are other positions apart from the one they are interested in” he said. The governor added that his government would not condone political thuggery and  violence, saying that anyone who promote these vices would be made to face the full weight of the law.
