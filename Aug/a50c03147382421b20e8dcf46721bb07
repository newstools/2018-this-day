By Francis Sardauna in Katsina The Speaker of the Katsina State House of Assembly, Hon. Abubakar Yayaha Kusada, has predicted that the ruling All Progressives Congress would win the ongoing Katsina north senatorial bye election. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had earlier fixed August 11, 2018 for the conduct of a by-election in the zone, following the death of Senator Mustapha Bukar. Hon. Kusada, who disclosed this to newsmen in Kusada, his hometown on Saturday while reacting to the ongoing election in the zone, said APC had better chances of winning. He said: “We will win the election with a wider gap because the people are voting for our party. So, I believe we will win the election”. The speaker, however, lauded INEC officials for what he described as timely arrival of election materials at polling units across the zone. While urging the electorate to conduct themselves in a peaceful manner during and after the exercise, Kusada commended them for coming out en-mass for the elect.
