One of Nigeria’s leading kitchen manufacturers and distributors of Bosch home appliances has revealed that the company is currently being restructured for greater productivity. Speaking at an event recently, the Chief Executive Officer of Pedini Nigeria, Chiedu Nwokolo said, “over the past two years, Pedini has been building its brand identity and listening to the pleas of her customers and prospective clients and we have been re-strategising and repositioning to serve you better.” Explaining further, he stated that “we are currently working on a deal where clients who purchase our entry level kitchens, that is the Vurn brand, would get an insurance cover for their family members from one of Nigeria’s leading insurance companies. “We are also currently running a promotion whereby customers who purchase a Vurn kitchen would get 50 per cent off on the next kitchen purchase, which means that two friends can partner to buy two kitchens for a fraction of the price.”
Also speaking at the event, the chief operating officer, Emmanuel Enejoh said, “Pedini is poised to be the premier destination for all products kitchens and has the vision to become the largest kitchen manufacturer in the sub-Saharan region by 2025.” Enejoh said the Pedini group would expand its product offering, with additional products related to the consumer end of the kitchen and food industry, saying, “We are excited about our future and our past achievements and hope to recruit the right set of skills to help us fulfil the dream of our founder.” Speaking further, Enejoh stated, “We want to be here for another 100 years and counting. We are also heavily investing in IT and customer service to help us provide much better and faster customer experience to our loyal and future clients.
“Providing flawless and superior after sales sometimes is a challenge within the country because of the lack of zeal and determination to strive for excellence within the work force.”
