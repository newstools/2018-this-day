Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu The pan-Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo yesterday asked the outlawed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) to stop antagonising its leaders in the overall interest of Ndigbo. It said this in a statement the Special Adviser on Media & Publicity to the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Emeka Attamah issued yesterday, condemning incessant attacks on the Igbo leaders. Even after the group’s President General, Chief Nnia Nwodo had clarified his stand on IPOB and efforts he had been making to seek redress for the organisation, the statement said IPOB was hell-bent on accusing Ohanaeze of complicity in its woes. It lamented that the IPOB derided Ohanaeze for its silence over the proposed Operation Python Dance III by the military on the same page of a newspaper the National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Uche Achi-Okpaga condemned the excersise. It added that Ohanaeze had resisted the temptation to join issues with IPOB “to avoid exacerbation of the situation that may jeopardise the interest of Ndigbo and make them a laughing stock to the rest of the country.” It commended the elder statesman Prof. Ben Nwabueze for his untiring efforts to broker peace between it and IPOB, though wondered at the silence of reputable Igbo sons and daughters in the face of the obvious provocation of Ohanaeze Ndigbo by IPOB. It, therefore, asked all Igbo people to call the IPOB to order. It called on the military to put the proposed excersise on hold, noting that it was coming on the heel of a similar excersise to which Igbo sons lost their lives. It warned that the proposed exercise could stir up unsavoury moments.
