*Melaye accuses Oshiomhole of collecting signatures to change senate leadership By Deji Elumoye in Abuja The Senator  representing Kwara South in the  National Assembly, Senator Rafiu Ibrahim, has alleged that senators belonging to the Parliamentary Support Group, PSG, received the sum of $1m each to impeach Senate President Bukola Saraki and his Deputy, Ike Ekweremadu. The lawmaker made the allegation in an interview this morning  at the lobby of the National Assembly in Abuja. Senator Ibrahim, who belong to Pro-Saraki group, also protested the invasion of the National Assembly by officers of the Department of State Services and Police Force. He said: “I can authoritatively tell you that those senators behind the desecration of the National Assembly collected $1m each to impeach the Senate President and his Deputy. You can quote me anywhere on this”. Another prominent member of the Pro-Saraki group, Senator Dino Melaye representing Kogi West district, accused the National Chairman of the All Progressive Congress (APC), of collecting signatures of lawmakers with the aim of effecting a leadership change in the upper chamber of the National Assembly. Melaye, while briefing his colleagues at the National Assembly lobby on the impeachment  plot by members of the PSG, said the APC national chairman Adams Oshiomhole was in a meeting with Pro-Buhari senators to collect signatures for Saraki and Ekweremadu’s impeachment. “The chairman of APC is currently meeting with some APC senators. As I speak, we understand he is collecting signature for the senate president’s impeachment. “We also understand that after collecting the signatures they will be proceeding to the National Assembly to carry out their plan. We are waiting for them”, the lawmaker added.
