 I Joined Army without My Parents’ Consent Emmy Benison is everything to look out for as he recently broke the Internet doing what he loves doing the most. Currently a solider in the Nigerian Army, he is very passionate about his musical call. In this chat with Tosin Clegg, he talks about starting music, his break out via social media, joining the army and lots more Tell us how it all started? I’m Emmanuel Odaudu but I’m well known as Emmy Benison, which is my stage name. I’m from Benue State and I started doing music in 2008 while in school. I formed a rap group known as United Choc Boyz but in 2013 I left the group and joined the army in 2014. What kind of music do you do? I do hip-hop and afro-pop but initially I was into Gospel because of my mum who is a spiritual kind of person, but I switched from gospel to hip-hop in school. My parents never supported my kind of music when they found out I’m into hip-hop but lots of persuasion from my elder ones made my parents to somehow listen to my songs. What have been the challenges so far? There have been a lot because I have been in occasions where I’m supposed to perform on stage but I will be on duty instead. It has been very challenging, but God has been good so far. Who are your musical influences? They are Eminem, MI Abaga, Jesse Jags and, especially, Nasty C. I like Nasty C a lot because the guy is way too talented. Where do you see yourself in a few years? I see myself doing music big time as I have passion for music and I enjoy doing it. I joined the army because I saw my friends who joined the system and they were like somehow important in the society. I lied to my parents about travelling to the village and that was how I left home to join the job without the consent of my parents. So, in a couple of years to come I will be doing music as a profession.
