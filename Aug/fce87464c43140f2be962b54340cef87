• Now on Sky channel 519 • New York, Washington DC imminent ARISE TV, a sister broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, has gone live in Europe, a statement by its Chairman, Prince Nduka Obaigbena, said Thursday in Lagos. Currently broadcasting on Sky channel 519 in Europe, the statement said it would soon hit the airwaves in New York and Washington DC. An elated Obaigbena thanked and congratulated all the people who made the station the success it had become.
According to him, “We have done this without accepting any state funding or becoming an instrument of propaganda between competing worlds from East to West: from Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the Middle East to the UK, France, Germany, Europe, USA and the Americas. “We are our own channel, fiercely independent in the pursuit of journalism of reason at the crossroads of a changing world, and the crosshairs of technology.” This, he said, did not come easy, explaining that the organisation had to go through some rough times before it stabilised. He said: “Today, five years later, the entrepreneurial spirit has won over some harrowing and challenging moments; hope has won over despair; truth is triumphant over lies; though we’ve had some tears along the way – not of our making, it has also been lots of fun and laughter and your one and only global news channel, that is truly Black and African, is standing taller today than ever before. “We thank all of those whose sacrifices contributed to bringing ARISE to live and salute those who keep it thriving.” Arise TV already broadcasts out of Africa, and its ARISE News Channel is on TV in 54 African countries, Europe and the USA as well as robustly online on every platform. “With news centres in Africa – Lagos, Abuja, Johannesburg and Nairobi; we remain in London and back and conquering in New York,” he said.
