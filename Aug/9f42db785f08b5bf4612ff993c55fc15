In the build-up to the All Progressives Congressâ€™s (APC) primary in 2015, Hon. Dayo Bush Alebiosu, who wanted to contest a seat in the House of Representatives, had exhibited great hope and confidence, perhaps for his bloated ego and overconfidence couples with his heavy financial war chest. He had also put in a lot of machinery to actualise his dream. But sadly, he lost the bid to Rotimi Agunsoye. Following this unsavoury development, the former two-term member of the Lower Chamber decided to take a back seat in the political and social scenes. But the decision has greatly affected his popularity and influence. He may not have resigned to fate, as he was said to have made some efforts to stage a comeback in preparation for the 2019 election. But the plans reportedly fell flat on his face even before taking off. Observers say his two-term victory was facilitated by his father, Alhaji Bushura Alebiosu. But he lost his shine when he was defeated by Agunsoye in the party primary. While in the House, he served in many committees, including National Security, Petroleum (Upstream) and was a former sub-committee chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), among others.
