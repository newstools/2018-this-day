In a move to deepen financial inclusion in the country, Oradian and the Association of Non Bank Microfinance Institution of Nigeria (ANMFIN), have launched a strategic partnership. The partnership will enable ANMFIN to promote access to financial services for Nigerian clients on a larger scale, by using its Cloud Express, a core banking system specially built for ANMFIN and its microfinance institution members. ANMFIN Cloud Express, powered by Instafin, is a cloud-based toolset tailored to enable smaller Nigerian microfinance institutions to benefit from a cloud-based solution. Commenting, president of the association, Adesola Ogunleye, said: “We are extremely pleased with this partnership. Together we align our shared vision and leverage the success delivered to date. The partnership will enable all of our MFIs to move to Oradian’s cloud-based solution, helping our members to save time and money through more efficient, digitised processes – no more manual input of data. “We and our members are very excited to improve administrative process, reduce high operational costs and offer digital financial services across the country.”
Chief Executive Officer of Oradian, Antonio Separovic stated that the innovation further expands the range of solutions that the firm offers in Nigeria. “Nigeria was our first market when we started six years ago and we remain committed to solving the financial inclusion challenge here. This partnership is a long-term partnership that is an important step towards this goal.”
He further added that the partnership would enable more financial institutions to take advantage of technology to become more efficient, grow and reach more unbanked individuals in rural communities.
