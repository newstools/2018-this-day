Mohammed Aminu in Sokoto Some former Special Advisers and Special Assistants to Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State monday restated their loyalty to the governor and the Peoples Democratic
Party (PDP). The aides were reacting to the reports about the purported resignation of some of their colleagues and their resolve to remain in the All Progressives Congress (APC).
Speaking on behalf of the governor’s former special assistants , the Secretary, Forum of Special Assistants, Alhaji Nasiru Shamaki, said those that reportedly claimed to have resigned their appointment were not telling the truth as the governor had already dissolved all special advisers and assistants in the state. He maintained that their loyalty to the governor remains firm, despite their dissolution. According to him, the aides would work for the success of the PDP in the next general elections. “We have never seen a gentleman worthy of our trust, leadership and emulation like Governor Tambuwal. And we will ensure his success in the forthcoming election,” he said. He also countered their claim that the governor has performed woefully in the last three years, describing the statement as false. Some Special Advisers and Assistant had on Sunday announced their resignation on grounds of Tambuwal’s defection to the PDP and what they called his “abysmal performance” in the state. However, the Director General, Media and Publicity to the Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Shekara, said the aides resigned to pre-empt their planned sack by Governor Tambuwal.
