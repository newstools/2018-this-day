Vanessa Obioha with agency reports There are reports that Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pine who were billed to join the cast of Star Trek fourth installment are unlikely to feature in the film. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the two actors were in negotiations with the companies making the new installment, Paramount Pictures and Skydance Media, but the talks seem to have fallen apart, with both sides walking away from the table. Pine and Hemsworth are said to be asking the studios to stick to existing deals, but Paramount says it is working on a budget and cannot afford the big figures the actors are requesting. The actors on the other hand insisted that they have deals in place and that the studios are reneging on them, forcing them to take pay cuts as they try to budget a movie that is following a mediocre performer. Pine who signed up for a fourth movie when he made his deal for ‘Star Trek Beyond’ was expected to reprise his role as iconic sci-fi hero Captain Kirk, which he has inhabited for three movies, while Hemsworth was to have played his father in a time-traveling adventure. Hemsworth played the role in the prologue in the 2009 movie that rebooted the franchise. At the moment, the certainty that the actors will be called back is not clear but deals with other returning cast members like Zoe Saldana and Simon Pegg are expected to follow.
