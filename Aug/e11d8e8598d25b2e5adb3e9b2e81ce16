By Vanessa Obioha with agency reports Comedian Chris Rock will be joining the next installment of the Noah Hawley’s FX anthology ‘Fargo’ which begins production in 2019. It is the comedian and actor’s first full-time TV series in nearly a decade. “I’m a fan of Fargo and I can’t wait to work with Noah,” Rock said. Rock will play the head of one family, a man who in order to prosper has surrendered his oldest boy to his enemy and who must in turn raise his son’s enemy as his own. FX CEO John Landgraf revealed that it was Hawley who reached out to Rock and discussed the fourth season with him. The actor he said signed on right away. Season four will tell a story of immigration and assimilation, and the things people do for money. In typical Fargo fashion, it’s a story of decent people who are probably in over their heads.
