 The Nigeria Football Federation is in talks with the Saudi Arabian Football Federation (SAFF) over a friendly between the two nations next month, allnigeriasoccer.com reports. If the two associations can agree terms, then the international friendly will be held on September 11, three days after the Super Eagles tackle Seychelles in their second group match of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. The last time Nigeria and Saudi Arabia faced off in a friendly on May 25, 2010, the two nations battled to a goalless draw. In the latest FIFA world ranking, the Super Eagles potential opponent is ranked 70th, while they occupy the fifth position among Asian Football Confederation countries. The Saudi Arabian national team have won the AFC Asian Cup three times and won the regional Arabian Gulf Cup in 1994, 2002 and 2003 plus the Arab Nations Cup in 1998 and 2002. Nigeria international strikers Ahmed Musa and Joseph Akpala completed moves to Saudi Professional League clubs Al-Nassr and Faisaly respectively this month.
