The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, Mr. Olusegun Agbaje, who spoke in Osogbo, the state capital, weekend, stated that the names of the 48 governorship candidates and their deputies have been pasted in the state office of INEC. Agbaje also refuted the allegation that the commission has connived with a political party to release unclaimed Permanent Voters’ Card (PVCs) to them, saying that the allegation is “unfounded and baseless”. He explained that the PVC of a unit can never work in another polling unit, wondering why politicians would make such allegation against the commission.
