Martins Ifijeh The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), has announced additional development assistance in support of moves to achieve the development goals outlined in the bilateral Development Objectives Assistance Agreement between US and Nigeria, which was signed in 2015. According to the acting Mission Director, USAID, Erin Holleran, in a statement made available to THISDAY recently, he said of the new funding, 25 million dollars will strengthen good governance by supporting state governments’ efforts to bolster Nigeria’s Open Government Partnership commitments to improve transparency and fight corruption. Meanwhile, an additional 1.5 million dollars will support a healthier, more educated population in targeted states through the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), for a total of 26.5 million dollars in additional assistance. He said USAID was also partnering federal and state health ministries to build stronger health systems with the aim of guaranteeing equitable access to quality healthcare services nationwide. The statement reads in part: “The additional new funding brings the total U.S. government assistance provided under the five-year Development Objectives agreement to 1.1 billion dollars. “The United States believes that Nigeria as the most populous country in Africa, with the largest economy on the continent, holds tremendous influence over the future of Africa. USAID is committed to partnering the government and the people of Nigeria to address its development challenges.” USAID collaborated with Nigeria’s ministries of budget and national planning, health, agriculture, power, and education, as well as state-level government counterparts to structure the bilateral assistance agreement, which runs through 2020.
