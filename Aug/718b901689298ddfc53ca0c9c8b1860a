 Former Cameroon Captain, Samuel Eto’o, has signed for Qatar Sports Club. The Qatari top-flight club announced yesterday the signing on their Twitter account, saying they would hold a “press conference to present the international star Samuel Eto’o”. The 37-year-old moves to Qatar after leaving Turkish club Konyaspor by mutual consent earlier this month. He joins ex-Spain international Xavi and former Netherlands player Wesley Sneijder in the Qatari league. Eto’o, a four-time African footballer of the year, played with Xavi at Barcelona, and Sneijder at Inter Milan, winning the Champions League with both teams. He has also played in England – for Chelsea and Everton – and Russia.
