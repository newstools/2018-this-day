 The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has advised all intending travellers to stop patronising unregistered travel agents, who reportedly defraud air passengers about N1 billion annually.
NCAA, which issued the warning in Lagos yesterday, said the caution became necessary in view of the complaints it has received in recent times.  NCAA stated that there are guidelines for registration with the authority, noting that the applicant must fulfil both the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and NCAA requirements to be registered. “The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority therefore reiterates that prospective passengers should do business only with travel agencies registered with the Regulatory Authority,” the statement also said. While decrying the activities of illegal travel agents, the NANTA President, Bankole Bernard had explained that the identity card would give stakeholders and travellers the ability to identify who are members and who are the real practitioners. “People get to the airport and they realise that what they have with them is reservation papers and that they have lost their monies; therefore, we felt this must not continue and we must put a stop to it,” Bernard said.
