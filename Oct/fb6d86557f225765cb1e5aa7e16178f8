On the presidential category of next year’s election, a lot has happened and still going to happen, all coming together to make some good sense for 2019. For President Buhari, his certificate issue has crept into public debate again and it does not seem like it is going to go away soon. Although his men have gone to town to market him, riding on a Town Hall meeting to tell Nigerians what they do not know about their president and his achievements, this is however colouring their narratives. That this moves were coming out at a time The Economist, did another report insisting Buhari would lose next year’s election, is enough to stir a rethink of strategy. But it has changed the tenor of campaigns and suddenly, it appears all contending parties see the need for an issue-based campaign. In the PDP, Atiku is though in faraway Dubai for a short rest, his team is getting ready to hit the space soon with a bang. Although the former vice-president recently cried to the international community to intervene in the election and not let the ruling party rig him out, his choice of Mr. Peter Obi as running mate is becoming a burden all of a sudden.
However, with a new Electoral Act passed recently by the National Assembly and people canvassing taxable donations for parties and candidates, next year’s presidential election may not be business as usual.
