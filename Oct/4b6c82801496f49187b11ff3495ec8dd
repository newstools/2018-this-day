We are the key actors in this initiative,” he said. Olojo added:”We expect agents from all the state chapters and more important for us is the need to have a round table discussion with the regulators, operators, agents and other stakeholders. We are also trying to see how we can attract Insurance firms. As agents we can issue out third party insurance policies and more.We are also trying to play our role in CBN’s vision of achieving 80 per cent financial inclusions.” The essence of the conference is to create an avenue where operators, agents, regulator and stakeholders can come together to discuss common goals; to review past calendar year; to discuss challenges and proffer solutions. It will also serve as a forum to create enabling platform to showcase latest solutions and cutting edge technologies in the industry.
