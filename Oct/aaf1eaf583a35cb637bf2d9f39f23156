Lewis Hamilton will start the US Grand Prix on pole position as he seeks to take the final step towards wrapping up a fifth world title. The Mercedes driver beat title rival Sebastian Vettel by 0.061 seconds but the German will be demoted to fifth on the grid because of a penalty. Hamilton will clinch the title today if he wins the race and Vettel finishes lower than second. Potentially crucially for Vettel, his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen starts second, ahead of the second Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas. Vettel will also be behind the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo, who qualified fifth but will be promoted to fourth by the Germanâ€™s penalty.
