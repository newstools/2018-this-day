With this Supreme Court ruling, I think you should just give up. Wike is just too strong. The man has defeated you in every contest and now even your protégé Abe is trying you. Supreme Court I hear has finally rubbished everything leaving you very weak in a state where you used to be the ultimate power man. So where is the relevance now, which state or region will you deliver to the presidency? Mbok, it is very sad o. Better come let us go and try PMAN presidency Rivers Sate Chapter before that one sef block. I am still praying for you sha, but seriously, I do not really see how you can achieve anything significantly in Rivers State while Wike is there. By the way, why is a plate of Afang so expensive in this Port Harcourt? Where is NLC when we need them abeg?
