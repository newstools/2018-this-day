By Gboyega Akinsanmi Lagos State Governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, has conceded defeat and congratulated his opponent, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who was declared winner of Tuesday’s All Progressives Congress governorship primary. Conceding defeat in a state-wide broadcast Wednesday afternoon, Ambode congratulated Sanwo-Olu, who Chief Clement Ebri, the chairman of the governorship election panel  set up by APC National Working Committee, had earlier declared winner of the primary. Ambode acknowledged that the last few days “have witnessed intense political activities that have gripped the attention of the nation and created palpable tension in the polity. “I strongly believe that the time has now come for the state to move forward in order that the gains of the last three and half years are not lost. “APC is a great party and the interests of our beloved state must always supersede that of any person or group. It is in this regard that I wholeheartedly congratulate the winner of the Lagos State APC primaries, Sanwo-Olu.” He, therefore, urged all Lagos residents “to immediately support our party’s gubernatorial candidate in the 2019 elections and work for the success of our dear party. “As the governor of Lagos State, I will do everything possible to ensure a smooth transition in the remaining period of this administration and ultimately to the new governor, come May 2019.” He, also, appealed to all members of the APC to remain one family and unite behind the candidate of the party so that the party could continue to move this state forward.
