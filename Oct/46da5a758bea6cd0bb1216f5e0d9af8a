By Vanessa Obioha with agency reports The Los Angeles Lakers legend, Shaquille O’Neal, has joined the Oscar race with his documentary feature ‘Killer Bees’. The 82-minute feature is centred on the primarily black Bridehampton High School Basketball team nicknamed Killer Bees and its coach Carl Johnson as they defended their 2015 state title while simultaneously confronted with racism, gentrification and income inequality. “This is a story that needs to be told,” Shaq told the Hollywood Reporter. Shaq shares producer credit with art dealer/gallerist Larry Gagosian while his friend Glenn Fuhrman who showed him the film is the executive producer.
The film which enjoyed favourable reviews at various festivals willl be screened for the first time in Hollywood to friends and members of the Academy’s documentary branch next Wednesday. It is expected that the documentary will make the shortlist for the best documenatry feature Oscar.
