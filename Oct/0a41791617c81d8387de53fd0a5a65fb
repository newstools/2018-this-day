Lekan Fatodu British-Ghanaian tailor, Ozwald Boateng, has been tasked with redesigning the uniforms for British Airways. The new uniform will form part of the airline’s celebrations for its centenary next year and is part of its five-year investment plan, which will see the airline invest 4.5 billion pounds to overhaul the interior of its long-haul aircrafts as well as install WiFi on every seat. Boateng, known for bringing a modern contemporary twist to British institution, launched his first women’s wear collection earlier this year. He will be designing a collection for the airline’s 32,000 employees who wear a uniform in playing their roles. In a statement, British Airways said the OBE-honoured designer would be “working closely” with the airline’s employees throughout the development process – from shadowing them to understand their roles and how the uniforms need to perform, to design, testing and final delivery. The Boateng-designed uniforms will be worn by flight crew, cabin crew, customer service agents, special services agents, ramp operators, baggage handlers, cargo employees, and engineers. “I am really excited about creating this new uniform for British Airways,” the accomplished designer said in his remark. “It is important for me to create something that makes all of British Airways’ 32,000 uniform-wearing employees across the world excited, at the same time as enabling me to really demonstrate my skills as a designer.
“I’m looking forward to taking a uniform and refining it into a collection.”
