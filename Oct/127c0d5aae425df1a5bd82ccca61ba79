By Laleye Dipo in Minna The Chairman of Suleja Local Government in Niger State, Alhaji Abdullahi Make, has been kidnapped. Make was kidnapped on his way home from the local government secretariat Wednesday evening. It was learnt that some armed men waylaid his official car and forced him into another vehicle before driving him to an unknown destination. The abduction of the local government boss came a few hours to the House of Representatives primary election of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the area. In the last couple of days, tension had risen in the local government as the countdown to the primary election began. No fewer than 15 people were injured and about 13 vehicles damaged in a clash between two aspirants for the single seat in the area. It was believed that the abduction of the council chairman could be linked to the primary election as he was suspected to be sympathetic to the aspiration of one of the aspirants. The police in Minna could not be reached for comment but a high ranking officer of the force, who declined to confirm the incident, officially directed THISDAY to the Police Public Relations Officer. “You know I cannot talk, we have our mouthpiece, please go to him,” the officer said.
