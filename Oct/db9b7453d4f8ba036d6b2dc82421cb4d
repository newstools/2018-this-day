By Vanessa Obioha Kensington Palance just announced on Twitter that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, are expecting a child in the spring of 2019. “Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019,” the tweet reads. Markle’s pregnancy comes five months after she tied the knot with Harry at Windsor Castle.
Before the announcement, there were speculations that the Duchess was pregnant after being photographed in Sydney, Australia, carrying purple binders. Meghan is a 37 year-old American actress who forfeited the glamorous life of the silver screen for a royal one with 34 year-old Prince Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II.
