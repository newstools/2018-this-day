By Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja The All Progressives Congress (APC) has expressed confidence in the ability of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct free, fair and credible elections. The ruling party also shared similar optimism that the country’s judiciary has the capacity to resolve disputes that may arise from the electoral process. The party’s acting National Chairman, Mr. Niyi Adebayo, who made the disclosure when he received a 2019 election exploratory delegation of the European Union (EU) to the party’s national secretariat in Abuja on Monday said the party is ready for the forthcoming 2019 general election. Adebayo, who is the party’s Deputy National Chairman (South), thanked the EU for its longstanding interest and developmental support for the country’s electioneering. On APC’s assessment of the country’s election management body and the justice system ahead of the elections, Adebayo expressed confidence in the INEC ability to conduct free, fair and credible elections and the judiciary to resolve disputes that may arise from the electoral process. The EU Delegation Exploratory Team Leader Nicolay Paus, who spoke on behalf of the delegation, said the team has already met with other election stakeholders in the country to recommend whether the EU would deploy election observers to monitor the 2019 general election. “We have met with a range of electoral stakeholders – INEC, some political parties, ministries of foreign affairs and information, civil society and some of the international organisations – working on electoral support. “The purpose is really to collect as much information as possible to recommend whether to deploy an observer mission for the 2019 elections,” he said. According to him, the report of the delegation will enable the EU decide on how to deploy observer teams to cover the 2019 general election.
