The Indoor Sports Hall of the Teslim Balogun Stadium will Sunday be the focal point of boxing fans around the continent, as it hosts GOtv Boxing Night 16, tagged the “Independence Edition”. This is the first time Teslim Balogun is hosting the event. A total of nine bouts, including two with international flavour, are scheduled. Headlining the show will be the West African Boxing Union (WABU) lightweight title bout between Ghana’s Benjamin Lamptey and Nigeria’s Rilwan Oladosu. The second international bout is a challenge duel between Ghana’s Emmanuel Mensah and Nigeria’s Oto Joseph, the African Boxing Union (ABU) lightweight champion. The other big- name match-ups are the national light heavyweight title duel between Kabiru Towolawi and Adewale Masebinu as well as the featherweight challenge clash between Waidi “Skoro” Usman and Chibuzo Obi.
