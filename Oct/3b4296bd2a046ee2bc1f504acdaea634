At least nine people were injured when a woman blew herself up in the centre of Tunisia’s capital, Tunis, the interior ministry said. Eight of those hurt in the explosion on the Habib Bourguiba avenue, which runs through the middle of the city, were police officers. The ministry has described the blast, near the Municipal Theatre, as a “terrorist explosion”. No victim deaths have been reported at this stage. The attack comes at a time when the country’s vital tourism industry is starting to show signs of recovery, more than three years after two deadly terror attacks decimated visitor numbers. The first, an attack on the capital’s Bardo Museum in March 2015, left 22 people dead. Just a few months later, in June, another 38 people were killed in a resort in Sousse. Pictures from the scene of the attack show a large number of emergency service personnel in the area. The explosion was 200 metres from the French Embassy and on the same road as the interior ministry, local journalist Souhail Khmira told the BBC. He arrived at the scene 15 minutes after the explosion and said a cloud of black smoke was visible from far away. He reports that police have barricaded the street and it is still closed.(BBC)
