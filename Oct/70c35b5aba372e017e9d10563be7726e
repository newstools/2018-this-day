Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja For the umpteenth time, the Initiative for Integrity and Good Leadership (IIGL) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari not to ignore calls by Nigerians to him and swiftly set up an investigative panel to probe allegations of certificate forgery against his Special Adviser on Prosecution Okoi Obono-Obla. The group reiterated that the continuous presence of the presidential aide in the cabinet would erode the integrity of the administration known for probity and war against corruption. Speaking during a press briefing in Abuja Sunday, the National President of the group, Muhammadu Aliyu, said the group was worried by the deafening silence of the president on the matter despite calls from different stakeholders that Obono-Obla, who is also the Chairman of Presidential Panel on Recovery of Government Property, should resign his appointment. The group had warned about two weeks ago that it would begin a mass action in 30 days if Obono-Obla did not resign from Buhari’s cabinet. Obono-Obla had been indicted by a report of the House of Representatives for result forgery and misuse of public funds. Aliyu stated: “We urge President Muhammadu Buhari not to ignore calls by Nigerians to probe his special aide on prosecution. “His recent Executive Order 6 has shown that the president meant business with his war against corruption, but such war would be seen as to be one sided if Obono-Obla is still in the government with such indictment and not investigated and sanctioned if found guilty.” On the threat of mass action issued by his group, he said the 30 days ultimatum is counting as the presidential aide has less than 15 days within which to toe the path of honour by tendering his resignation letter.
