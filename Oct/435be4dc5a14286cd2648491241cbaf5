AITEO CUP FINAL Determined to end Cup jinx for the Sai Masu Gida, the Kano State government has boosted the morale of Kano Pillars players and officials by paying outstanding 11-match bonuses to them ahead of their AITEO Cup final against Enugu Rangers on Wednesday. The final game is to be staged at the Stephen Keshi Stadium in Asaba, Delta State. Spokesman of Kano Pillars, Idris Malikawa, confirmed the payment yesterday and stressed that the camp of the Kano State owned team is full of life again as the players have resolved to pay back the gesture with victory against the Flying Antelopes. “It’s a big boost for the team as we prepare for the AITEO Cup final against Enugu Rangers on Wednesday. All the allowances and bonuses owed the team amounting to N7 million have been cleared and no one is owed in the club now,” Malikawa revealed. Kano Pillars is yet to win the FA Cup despite having won the league on several occasions. The final may also turn out an avenue for any of the players of both teams to play themselves into the national team as Super Eagles Technical Adviser, Gernot Rohr who returned to the country after the reverse fixture defeat of Libya in Sfax, Tunisia on Tuesday night is going to watch the epic final. The Eagles chief handler has been widely criticised for overlooking players from the domestic league, preferring to work with players based overseas. However, he has maintained that the country’s best players do not play locally. The cup winners will represent Nigeria in next year’s CAF Confederation Cup.
