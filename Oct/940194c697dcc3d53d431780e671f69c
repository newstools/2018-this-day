By Vanessa Obioha Nollywood actor Richard Mofe-Damijo alongside rappers Falz and Phyno will be joining 2Baba to headline the musical concert ‘Buckwyld ‘n’ Breathless’. Scheduled for Saturday, October 20 at the Eko Convention Centre, Eko Hotels and Suites, the fully-scripted show by 2Baba will revolve round the theme ‘Power of 1’ which reinforces the belief that one person’s affirmative action can deliver positive outcomes and challenge young Nigerians to embrace the responsibility of fixing Nigeria one challenge at a time. Speaking on why he started the Buckwyld ‘n’ Breathless concert, 2Baba stated that “Nigerians love good music and great live performances, so I’m keeping that spirit alive because it’s the only place where people get to appreciate and enjoy an artist’s full expression of their art, gift and talent.” The concert also marks the official launch of the social movement campaign inspired by the soon to be released movie titled ‘Power of 1’.
