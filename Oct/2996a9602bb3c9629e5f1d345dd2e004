The motion, which was seconded by Senator Emmanuel Bwacha(PDP Taraba North), will see the upper legislative chamber which resumed from its over two-month long annual vacation barely a month ago proceed on break for another two weeks. Lawan while moving the motion for adjournment of plenary equally welcomed Senator Osinaka Chukwu(PDP Rivers West) who just defected to the APC to the ruling party. Senate President Bukola Saraki, in his remarks, said during the two-week recess of the Senate, the relevant committees will meet with a view to carrying out oversight functions especially on the implementation of the 2018 federal budget and the recently approved external loan (Eurobond) .
