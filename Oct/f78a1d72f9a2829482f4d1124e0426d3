Jonathan Eze Arrangements are in top gear to ensure a historic hosting of the 2018 edition of National Festival of Arts and Culture (NAFEST) in Rivers State, South-South, Nigeria. According to a statement from the Director-General, National Council for Arts and Culture, Segun Runsewe, the Council is fully prepared to showcase the glamour of Nigeria’s diverse cultures to the world during the festival which is slated to hold from October 21 to 27. Runsewe was upbeat that 2018 NAFEST will be the best ever following the massive mobilisation of equipment and facilities including the mass exodus of stakeholders from all parts of Nigeria to Rivers State for the one-week fanfare. “A lot of visitors both from within and outside Nigeria are on their way to Rivers State and I can confirm to you that reports reaching us from the Local Organising Committee (LOC) indicate that hotels are in for good business,” he stated. Adding, “This is a major boost and it is good for the economy of Rivers State and by extension, Nigeria because the massive participation and influx of people from all works of life will ensure very high commercial activities in the state.” Runsewe expressed particularly his excitement about the level of involvement by Rivers youths who are set to take full advantage of NAFEST 2018 in not only showcasing Rivers Culture, but by also benefiting from the numerous youth empowerment components of NAFEST initiated by the NCAC. He enjoined all stakeholders and indeed Nigerians to support NAFEST 2018 as a unifying force for cultural integration and harmony just as he affirmed the NCAC’s total commitment in projecting Nigeria’s rich culture throughout the fiesta. Runsewe thanked the Executive Governor of Rivers State, his Excellency, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike and the good people of the state for aligning with NCAC in its drive towards a successful hosting of NAFEST which according to the NCAC chief is a reaffirmation of the governor’s commitment towards hosting the best NAFEST ever.
