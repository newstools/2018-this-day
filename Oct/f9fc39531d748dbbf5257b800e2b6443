Nigeria manager Gernot Rohr has admitted that he was surprised by the decision of Chelsea winger Victor Moses who decided to quit the national team less than two months after he represented the country at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. One of the reasons why the Blues number 15 decided to quit the Super Eagles was to concentrate on his career with the Premier League side, however, he has found playing opportunities hard to come by this season. Bordeaux summer signing Samuel Kalu has struggled to replicate the performances of Moses after three matches for the Super Eagles in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. ‘’I have to admit that it did come as a surprise, but we had to accept it. He wanted to focus more on his family and club,’’ said Rohr to Kick Off Magazine. ‘’Unfortunately, he is now not playing regularly at Chelsea. He is only 27 and it really was a bit surprising, but we have to live with it. ‘’We tried to find a replacement for him and found Kalu from Bordeaux, who has done well so far.’’ Moses was one of the stars when Nigeria won the Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 and scored 12 goals in 38 appearances for the Super Eagles.
