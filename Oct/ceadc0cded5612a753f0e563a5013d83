Novak Djokovic continued his superb form on Sunday by beating Croatia’s Borna Coric in the final of the Shanghai Masters. The second seed, 31, beat 21-year-old Coric 6-3 6-4 in 97 minutes to claim his fourth Shanghai title. Coric, the 13th seed, upset Roger Federer in Saturday’s semi-finals to reach his first Masters 1000 final. Serb Djokovic has won 18 consecutive matches since losing at the Rogers Cup on 10 August, and will replace Federer as world number two on Monday. The 14-time Grand Slam champion cruised through the first set, dropping just four points on his serve. Coric recovered from 3-0 down in the second to earn a break point at 3-2 before saving three championship points to break Djokovic and make it 5-4. But Djokovic won his 26th straight set to clinch his fourth title of 2018 and go just 35 points behind Rafael Nadal in the ATP Race for London. Djokovic’s winning run includes victory at the Cincinnati Masters in August, when he became the first player to win all nine Masters 1000 tournaments.
