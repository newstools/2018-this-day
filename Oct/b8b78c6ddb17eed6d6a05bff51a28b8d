Frontline governorship aspirant in Imo State, Sir Stanley Amuchie, has urged the people of the state to be steadfast in the hope that salvation is on the way. In his message to the people of Imo State to mark Nigeria’s 58th independence anniversary on Monday, Sir Stanley, who is running on the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), said the anniversary celebration was an opportunity for all Imo indigenes to thank God for nationhood. The full statement reads:
“Happy Independence Day to the good people of Imo State. Today affords us another opportunity to thank God for the journey of nationhood thus far, notwithstanding the bumpy road we have been travelling. We, however, have another opportunity to attain true independence in the affairs of our dear state. “As the political parties choose their candidates to fly their flags at the 2019 elections we must take a deep dive into the history and character of those presenting themselves for election. We cannot afford the mistakes of the past. Our state deserves the best and it is in our hands to make it happen. I urge the good people of Imo State to remain vigilant at this time. It is about our future and that of our children and generations yet unborn. Let us collectively restore the glory of our dear State.”
