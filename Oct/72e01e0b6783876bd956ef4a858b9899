Emma Okonji Access Bank has restated its commitment to provide innovative, secure and convenient banking services to its customers, while promising customers that the bank will not relent in such commitment. The Chief Executive Officer of the bank, Herbert Wigwe, gave the assurance when he met with his Microsoft counterpart, Satya Nadella, in the United States, recently, to discuss issues and methods regarding how the bank could further leverage on technology to solidify banking security in the country. The meeting provided an extensive opportunity for the bank to further build on its current relationship with Microsoft, with discussion on how both companies could work together to revolutionise digital banking experience and create additional and new forms of value in Nigeria and Africa. Both CEOs, according to a statement, discussed the bank’s efforts to reform banking practices on the continent, creating easy and secured banking experience for customers, including quick methods to address financial inclusion, especially through Access Bank’s existing structures that promote financial technology such as mobile banking, the African Fintech Foundry, among many others. Speaking on the meeting, Wigwe said: “This meeting is very strategic for Access Bank and could not have come at a better time. Right now, we are much focused on providing innovative solutions and leveraging technology across various platforms in our quest to open Africa to the world which is our five-year goal.” With its track record in innovative products such as the Access Africa, the cross-border transfer service, which is the fastest way to send and receive money across Africa seamlessly, PayDay Loan and the recently-launched Access WhatsApp Banking service, Access Bank has consistently provided customers with seamless banking services that have proven to be fast, affordable, and convenient, Wigwe said.
