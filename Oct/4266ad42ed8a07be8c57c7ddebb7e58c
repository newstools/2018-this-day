Victor Ogunje in Ekiti An Ekiti State High Court Friday refused to grant an order seeking to restrain the governor-elect, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, from sacking the 16 local government councils when he assumes office. The suit was filed to preempt what may happen after Fayemi takes over
on Tuesday, October 16. The council chiefs, led by the state Association of Local Governments
of Nigeria (ALGON) Chairman, Hon. Dapo Olagunju, had approached the
court seeking an interlocutory injunction to stop Fayemi from sacking them. Striking out the application in a ruling, Justice Abiodun Adesodun
described the application as “unmeritorious, pre-emptive and
speculative”. Justice Adesodun said there is no compelling fact in the application
to warrant the granting of the order. The judge subsequently adjourned the substantive matter to October 22. The council bosses filed the case through their lawyer, Mr. Obafemi
Adewale, while Mr. Tajudeen Akingbolu and Mr. Adeoye Aribasoye appeared for Fayemi. Counsel to the defendant (Fayemi) challenged the jurisdiction of the court to hear the application on the grounds that the matter was speculative.
