By Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti Former Commissioners for Finance, Dapo Kolawole and Justice and Attorney General of Ekiti State, Mr Wale Fapohunda, were Thursday screened and confirmed by the state Assembly as commissioners-designate. The two were screened and confirmed to serve as commissioners in Dr. Kayode Fayemi’s administration. Fapohunda and Kolawole are expected to be handed the portfolios of Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice and Finance and Economic Development respectively. The duo served in the same capacities in the first term of Fayemi’s government. The Assembly at its plenary Thursday also endorsed Fayemi’s approval for the appointment of 10 special advisers. The Speaker, Hon. Adeniran Alagbada, who read a letter from the governor to his colleagues at plenary, urged them to adequately look into the request for smooth running of government. The two commissioner nominees were differently grilled by members of the House and were deemed qualified for membership of the State Executive Council. The lawmakers unanimously observed that both men had served the state in the past and performed creditably well. The duo are expected to be sworn in by the governor any moment from now. The Deputy Speaker Segun Adewumi charged the two commissioner nominees to think outside the box by attracting businesses to the state to improve the economy instead of overtaxing the people. Alagbada commended Fayemi “for choosing people of integrity as commissioners and praised his colleagues for their prompt action”.
