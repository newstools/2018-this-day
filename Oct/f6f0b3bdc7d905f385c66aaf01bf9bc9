He said there were ongoing plans to establish shared facility in partnership with the federal, state government and other relevant agencies in the state where several MSMEs can take advantage for easy and enhanced productivity.

Also speaking at the occasion, the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo noted that the MSME Clinic was part of the federal government’s efforts to bring relevant government agencies to MSMEs for ease of doing businesses. He entrepreneurs were better informed on issues of regulations and incentives available for their businesses since the inception of the initiative. He added: “The MSMEs Clinic is government’s way of paying attention to MSMEs. The one-stop-shop initiative is where regulatory agencies are brought together under one roof for easy access for MSMEs, where all the MSMEs can go and get all of their relevant approvals without having to travel around the country.”
