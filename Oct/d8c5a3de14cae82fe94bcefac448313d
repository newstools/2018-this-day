Alexis Sanchez scored a dramatic late, late winner as Manchester United yesterday came from two goals behind to complete a thrilling 3-2 victory over Newcastle United at Old Trafford. Amid speculation that Jose Mourinho is set to be sacked by the board anytime soon, United made a horrific start as goals from Kenedy on seven minutes and Yoshinori Muto three minutes later put the visitors two goals clear. After witnessing one of the worst first-half performances at Old Trafford in recent history, Mourinho changed to a back-three at the break, with Paul Pogba placed at the heart of defence. And the response was immediate. The hosts spurned a couple of great chances before Juan Mata netted a beautiful free-kick on 70 minutes and Anthony Martial levelled matters on 76 minutes after a lovely move involving Pogba. With the clock ticking down, substitute Sanchez made the winning contribution as he nodded home from Ashley Young’s cross in the final minute of normal time to seal a dramatic three points for United – and perhaps save the job of their manager. Football journalists everywhere must have been writing their obituary to Mourinho as Manchester United manager at the half-time break. His team was hopeless, the Portuguese looked like a beaten man. However, he delivered the team-talk of his life and his team delivered. Any argument that the players don’t want to play for the 55-year-old was defeated, as United produced a stirring comeback. The last 20 minutes was almost like a tribute to Sir Alex Ferguson and how his teams used to play at Old Trafford. Various reports suggest Mourinho would be sacked post-match, no matter the result. It would take a very brave person to fire him after this.
