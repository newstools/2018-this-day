The Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode has approved the appointments into the Boards of 40 state sports associations. This was announced by the Executive Chairman of the Lagos State Sports Commission, Dr. Kweku Adedayo Tandoh who stated that the appointments take immediate effect and will be for a four-year tenure in line with the stipulations contained in the enabling Law of the Lagos State Sports Commission. It would be recalled that some months ago, the former Boards were dissolved as they had long exceeded their tenures. According to Dr. Tandoh, the new appointees were painstakingly selected to ensure that men and women with passion, knowledge and commitment for sports are brought on board. “We are certain that with the new Boards in place, the pace of sports development in the state, particularly grassroots sports development will be very much accelerated,” Tandoh said. Some of the 40 sports associations are Athletics, Badminton, Boxing, Cricket, Cycling, and Swimming. Others include Scrabble, Para-Athletics, Deaf Sports, Basketball, Judo and others. The Boards are expected to swing into action immediately especially in view of the forthcoming 19th National Sports Festival holding in Abuja in December 2018.
