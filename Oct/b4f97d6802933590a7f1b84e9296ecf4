By Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The national leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has sent the name of Engr. Abba Yusuf, the son-in-law of the former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the party’s gubernatorial candidate. The name of Yusuf was among the list of candidates submitted to the electoral body in Abuja last week Thursday. A party source who pleaded anonymity because he wasn’t authorised to speak on the issue told THISDAY that the name of Yusuf was submitted to INEC. Though, Malam Salihu Sagir Takai, who is believed to have the support of the Kano people also emerged as the governorship candidate of the Senator Mas’ud El-Jibril Doguwa-led faction of PDP in the state. But Kwankwaso had allegedly threatened to dump the PDP if the party’s top echelon tampered with the list of candidates returned from the parallel primaries he held for the various offices, including the governorship, national and state assembly. However, the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, denied the alleged threat by Kwankwaso, saying he was not aware of it. The source added: “Kwankwaso’s son-in-law, Yusuf’s name was submitted as the gubernatorial candidate in Kano.”
