Emmanuel Ukumba in Lafia The Nasarawa United Football Club and its Head Coach, Kabiru Dogo, have confirmed parting ways due to non-renewal of the coach’ contract which recently expired. Chairman of the Nasarawa United FC, Isaac Danladi and Coach Dogo both confirmed the development to journalists in Lafia yesterday. Danladi said that the separation of both parties was mutual, cordial, without any acrimony and all speculation on social media that Dogo resigned over any issue should be regarded as nothing but mere speculation. “His contract expired. That is what happened. He had a one season contract with us and it expired after we crashed out of the Aiteo Federation Cup semi finals against Rangers. So the contract was not renewed because we did not offer a renewal and he did not expect a renewal. So in simple terms, we severed relationship, he maintained. “It is not true he resigned because if you say someone resigned, it means he has a subsisting contract but his contract expired. I emphasize on this because we heard on different social media platform that he said he resigned which is not true,” He said. Speaking in a separate interview, Coach Dogo also confirmed that he parted ways with the club because his contract recently expired and in the course of the disengagement, no misunderstanding took place. “Nothing bad happened. I had a good working relationship with the management. I don’t have problem with anybody. It is just that my contract has expired. So I need to move forward. We had a mutual understanding. So there was no problem,” Dogo concluded.
