Vice President Professor Yemi Osibanjo is set to deliver the keynote address at the “Technology as a Catalyst: Ease of Doing Business,” conference scheduled to hold in Lagos tomorrow. The conference is organised by one of the leading law firms, Perchstone and Graeys in partnership with IT consultancy outfit Knowledge Resources. Other key officials expected at the conference are Dr. Okechukwu Enelamah, Minister of Industry, Trade, and Investment and Adebayo Shittu, Minister of Communications, and heads of technology intensive government parastatals are also expected to grace the event. Managing Director of Knowledge Resources, Gerald Ilukwe stated that the conference has the objective of highlighting the gains achieved so far from leveraging technology in public service delivery to enhance the ease of doing business in Nigeria. The event which would bring together stakeholders from both the public and private sectors would also seek to identify opportunities for further technology-driven improvement in reducing the menace of corruption and excessive bureaucracy as both remain major disincentives for foreign direct investment into Nigeria, the organisers stated. The organizers have stated that they will closely monitor the communiqué arising from this conference and hold both the public and private sectors accountable for its full implementation.
