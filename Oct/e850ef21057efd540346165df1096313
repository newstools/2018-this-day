By Vanessa Obioha with Agency Reports In an interview with BBC, Tina Turner revealed that she believed loneliness drove her son, Craig, to commit suicide. The 59 year-old Craig was found dead at his Los Angeles home from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in July. “I have no idea what pulled him down except something that followed him with loneliness. I think it was something with being alone.” Yet, Turner is puzzled that her son would die of loneliness because he expressed fulfillment and enthusiasm in his personal life after finding a new girlfriend before his untimely death. “I still don’t know what took him to the edge because at that stage he had said to me that he had never met a woman that he felt that way about. He was bringing her to meet me for his birthday in August. He had decorated his apartment that I bought for him years ago. He had gotten a new job with a prominent real estate company in California which he was very happy with. “ She added that her son was an introvert and a shy person and she didn’t notice any changes in their conversations until after the suicide. The singer also said that she was not afraid of death.
“Death is not a problem to me. I really don’t mind leaving.” . Sent from Yahoo Mail on Android
