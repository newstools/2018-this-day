The National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC) has promised to showcase Nigeria’s Cultural DNA at the forthcoming National Festival of Arts and Culture (NAFEST) set to hold in Port-Harcourt later this month. The best of Nigeria’s culture, arts, crafts and fashion will be on show as the Rivers State government hosts the yearly rotated festival of unity in the Garden City with the NCAC promising to re-launch the unity festival into global acceptance and inclusiveness. According to Director General of the NCAC, Otunba Segun Runsewe, the Port Harcourt edition will build on the success of last year’s edition held in Kaduna and will herald a massive repositioning of the entire gamut of Nigeria’s culture value chain. NAFEST in Port Harcourt will create a strategic learning curve on how to alleviate poverty and enthrone a new rural sustainable cultural economy through skill acquisition and exposure to other multi beneficial contents related to Nigerian culture, he said. Runsewe said, “The unity festival is coming at a time Nigeria has become the destination to watch as President Buhari’s diplomatic shuttling across the globe has attracted massive interest in Nigeria beyond the traditional business frontiers, hence the repositioning of culture as the central bank of our creative wealth.” The NCAC expects that Rivers State will take advantage of the Festival to redirect cultural tourism traffic to the oil city and the south-south region of Nigeria in general.
