Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday warned the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) not to contemplate bending the rules to smuggle in candidates from the Zamfara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The opposition party said it was aware of a clandestine meeting today between topmost officials of INEC and Zamfara State Government, where INEC was instructed to manipulate the system and bend the rules to accommodate the APC. The PDP in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, warned the Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu, over attempt to manipulate the processes and use underhand measures to liberate the APC from the cul de sac it plunged itself into in Zamfara State. He stated, “The PDP wants the APC and INEC to know that our party is at alert regarding all electoral processes, in line with our avowed determination to dismantle APC’s rigging machinery in the 2019 general elections. “Legally, all congresses and related processes for election of candidates for various offices for the 2019 general elections ended yesterday (Sunday, October 7, 2018), the Zamfara State chapter of the APC has not conducted any congress, and by the provision of the law, it has no candidates in all the elections. “We insist that the laws guiding our elections must be upheld, as the PDP will never accept anything short of that.”
