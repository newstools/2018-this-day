Michael Olugbode in Maiduguri The slow pace of development in the northern part of the country has been traced to the influence of cabals on the treasury of local government areas in the region. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday in Maiduguri, the candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Hawul State Constituency, Ishaku Mshelizza said to bring development to the north, these cabals must be confronted and fought to a standstill. He decried that Hawul has been dealt a blow by these cabals and he chose to aspire to represent the area in order to liberate the people of this problem. He said: “I shall ensure that the cabals influence over the local government treasury is broken and the electorate shall benefit from their statutory monthly allocations from the federal government.” Mshelizza promised that the impunity and lack of consultation with the electorate which has been the order of the day for the past seven and half years, will give way to a new way of doing things at the local government and at the House of Assembly when he is elected. He said: “I ventured into politics just to rescue the people of my constituency from the shackles of misrepresentation and misrule. “I shall ensure that, as soon as I am inaugurated after elections next year, the disregard to the views of the people at the Local government in the way of doing things shall cease.” He said: “The people of my constituency will witness positive change within three months of my coming into office.”
