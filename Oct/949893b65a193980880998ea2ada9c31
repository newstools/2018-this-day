The speakers and panellists who came from various backgrounds representing financial literacy, investment, employability, career growth, entrepreneurship and art/creativity, gave the students’ tips on how to be successful in their career and business, manage funds and invest wisely with small funds. Speaking to the students of the University of Lagos, the Managing Director, PAL Pensions, Morohunke Bammeke, was quoted to have said: “The vision of PAL Pensions is to be the best PFA by creating value. PAL Pensions is that company that will always add value to you.” She further averred that making money was not enough, preserving and investing wisely is what makes one wealthy. She encouraged the students to commit to lifelong learning to create sustainable success and charged them to go out and create the future. The event, targeted at young, social media savvy, forward-thinking students interested in not just career after graduation but also entrepreneurship was well attended by students in the participating institutions. Participants not only got the chance to learn from the experiences of the panellists, but they also got an opportunity to win fantastic prizes by taking part in the #SellYourself competition. “PAL Pensions is always interested in ways to impact the society positively,” the Head, Brand Management and Corporate Communications, Sunmisola Mark-Okoma said.
