Even though the preparation for the primary election has been perfected, factional Lagos State APC Chairman, Mr. Fouad Oki, yesterday sought the intervention of Buhari, Osinbajo and Oshiomhole in the chapter’s crisis. Oki made the call in an open letter to the APC National Chairman on the governorship primary election scheduled to hold in 20 Local Government Areas (LGAs) and 245 wards across the state today, warning that it might culminate in intractable crisis without the decisive intervention of Buhari, Osinbajo and Oshiomhole. In the letter he titled, “Before It Is too Late, Let us Avoid Intractable Crisis,” Oki explained the purpose of the letter, which according to him, was to the APC national chairman, the president and vice president to look into the crisis that had engulfed the party irredeemably in Lagos State. Oki said, “I am writing this to you on behalf of the teeming members of the Party in Lagos State before it is too late. I am writing to you as a fellow member of our great Party, of which you are also a member and the arrow head. “When family members are in conflict is it not the responsibility of family members, especially the elders or those who care deeply about the well being of the entire family, to make every attempt to solve the problem? Is it not far better to honestly address these deep conflicts since we share an identity, a progressive family? “I am addressing those in power. I am not writing this letter out of hatred, but out of love because there is so much bitterness and generalized resentment permeating the political environment in Lagos State.”
