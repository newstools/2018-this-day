Shola Oyeyipo in Abuja  The wife of President Muhammadu Buhari, Aisha, has regretted the ill-treatment of aspirants on the platform of her husband’s party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), dissociating herself from what she referred to as unfairness. Aisha, in a comment she tweeted at 8:11am yesterday, which attracted 5, 311 retweets, 5, 034 likes and 1, 064 comments as at 7pm, wondered how the degree of anomalies that occurred in the ruling party’s could be perpetrated under the watch of its National Chairman, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole. Bemoaning the plight of aspirants across the country, the Aisha tweeted, “It is disheartening to note that some aspirants used their hard earned money to purchase nomination forms, got screened, cleared and campaigned vigorously yet found their names omitted on Election Day. These forms were bought at exorbitant prices. “Many others contested and yet had their result delayed. Fully knowing that automatic tickets have been given to other people.” She said she was particularly disturbed that the APC, being a party whose cardinal principle was change and which was headed by a comrade-activist (Oshiomhole) whose main concern was for the common man would allow such level of impunity to take place. “Given this development one will not hesitate than dissociate oneself from such unfairness, be neutral and speak for the voiceless,” she said. According to her, it is best for Nigerians to resist such trend, saying, “It is important for the populace to rise against impunity and for voters to demand from aspirants to be committed to the provision of basic amenities such as potable drinking water, basic health care ( primary health care centers), education within conducive and  appropriate learning environments.” Apparently urging Nigerians to seek alternatives to the unpleasantness under the APC, she advised, “Let us vote wisely!”
