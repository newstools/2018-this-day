By Shola Oyeyipo in Abuja An ad hoc committee to be set up by the House of Representatives will investigate the N60 billion allegedly stolen from the coffers of the defunct Nigeria Airways Limited. The committee will, among other things, have the responsibility of fishing out those indicted in the scam and ensure that they are not only prosecuted but also made to refund the money. The position was taken after a motion sponsored by Hon. James Abiodun Faleke (APC, Lagos) under matters of urgent national importance calling for an urgent review of the Justice Obiora Nwazota Commission of Enquiry into the activities of the defunct Airways was adopted. Faleke had hinted in his motion that the commission’s report revealed the looting of N60 billion, and that the federal government had ordered the Ministry of Finance and the police authority to recover the fund to no avail. According to him, “Despite the release of the White Paper and the approval given to it as well as the directive to Federal Ministry of Finance and the police by the federal government, the previous government refused to prosecute the culprits indicted in the report.”
