Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State has become the highest ranked Nigerian institution in the prestigious world universities ranking of the Times Higher Education (THE). The Times Higher Education is the body behind the world’s most influential university ranking and with almost five decades of experience as a source of analysis and insight on higher education. Its data and benchmarking tools are used by many of the world’s most prestigious universities to help them achieve their strategic goals. According to the latest ranking released recently by THE in its office in Singapore, Covenant has been ranked within the 601-800 bracket. By this development, the university, established 15 years ago, has become the first Nigerian and also, arguably the first African institution to record such a milestone in a rather short time of existence. The feat came six years into the process of actualising the institution’s divine vision of becoming one of the top 10 universities in the world by the 2022, otherwise known as vision 10:2022. The current administration of the institution, led by the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Aderemi Atayero, had in its bid to rev up the drive towards the fulfilment of the vision, introduced the ‘ReCITe Agenda’, which would entail a research-intensive approach. The university believes that the ReCITe agenda would be accomplished through the instrumentality of ‘globalisation’, which means benchmarking with established (indisputable) world-class universities, while introducing innovations to address local contextual needs. So far, the agenda has been a phenomenal success with Covenant now boasting of 40 per cent of top 20 authors in Nigeria and the university only recently set a new record of over 600 publications so far in the year. The university had since inception lived up to the aspirations of its founder through unique curricula and quality teaching, cutting edge research, life-changing innovations and impactful community development programmes.
