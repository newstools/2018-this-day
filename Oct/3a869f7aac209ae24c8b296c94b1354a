By Vanessa Obioha with Agency Reports US President Donald Trump drew the ire of the family of late pop musician Prince when he played the singer’s songs at his rallies. The campaign team of the president had reportedly included the star’s hit song ‘Purple Rain’ in a campaign rally playlist in the lead up to the November midterm elections. The song was reportedly part of the president’s playlist in Mississippi last week. Reacting to that, Prince’s half-brother, Omarr Baker, tweeted: “The Prince Estate has never given permission to President Trump or The White House to use Prince’s songs and have requested that they cease all use immediately.” The singer is the latest addition to the list of musicians who object to their songs being played at Republican rallies. Other artistes on the list include Rolling Stones, Adele, Queen, George Harrison, Aerosmith, R.E.M. and Neil Young.
