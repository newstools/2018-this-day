The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, at the weekend paid a surprise visit to political leaders in his ward, Ward 4, in Oredo Local Government Area, a gesture political analysts describe as strategic in deepening relations with grassroots political leaders. Obaseki remains a strong advocate of ‘Bottom – Top’ approach to governance which ensures development is people-driven and impacts everyone at all levels of the society. The governor believes it is important for elected public officials to maintain healthy relations with members and leaders of the party at the grassroots, engaging them on developmental issues and seeking their counsel where necessary.
