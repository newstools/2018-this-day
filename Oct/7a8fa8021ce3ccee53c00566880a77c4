*Approves N242.245bn election budget Deji Elumoye in Abuja The Senate on Tuesday resolved to probe the alleged mismanagement of $3.8 billion Subsidy Recovery Fund, SRF, by the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC. This is sequel to a motion moved at plenary by the Minority Leader, Senator Biodun Olujinmi, who came under Orders 42 and 52 to draw the attention of the Senate to the alleged mishandling of $3.8 billion Subsidy Recovery Fund,SRF, in the custody of the NNPC. The Senator while speaking on the matter of urgent national importance accused both the Managing Director and an Executive Director of the NNPC as sole signatories to the Fund “without recourse to the National Assembly Joint Committee on Appropriation”. The Account, she said, has become a slush fund and therefore urged the Senate to compel its Committee on Petroleum(Downstream) to ask the NNPC on why the Fund was being managed by the Executive without the knowledge of the Legislature. Contributing, Senator Ali Ndume, opposed the suggestion that the Committee on Petroleum(Downstream) be allowed to look into the matter saying ” that call may not be necessary because if the committee had done its oversight properly it would have known what was going on with the Fund”.
Senator Ndume who sat close to Senator Buka Abba said he had just been told by Abba “that the Committee had compromised. The Chairman of the Committee on Petroleum(Downstream) Senator Kabir Marafa, was quick to respond by saying he took exception to Senator Ndume’s reservation about his committee’s competence although he also alluded to the fact that the said money may have become a slush fund.
Senate President, Bukola Saraki, while accepting the need to look into the matter however stressed the need for the upper legislative chamber to be guided by facts and figures. “Let us go by the fact available before us on this matter and will not want us to be partisan”, he further said.
The Senate President then named the Senate Leader, Senator Ahmad Lawan, as the Chairman of an Ad-hoc committee that will look into the matter and report back to Senate in four days.
The Senate Leader in reaction said he would decline to serve on the Committee but was overruled by the Senate President who said ” Leader of Senate there is no way you can exonerate yourself from leadership so you will chair the ad-hoc committee”. The Senate also on Tuesday approved the N242 .245billion budget for conduct of the elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC) and security agencies.
