Cyber security expert has urged organisations susceptible to cyber attacks to adequately and proactively deploy solutions that will mitigate such incidences. Managing Director/CEO, Infodata Nigeria, Chuks Udensi, stated this at ‘The human point story: Reinventing Cybersecurity conference’ organised by Infodata and Forcepoint in Lagos recently. He noted that the typical security challenges we have is that fraudsters are always trying to steal peoples’ information, noting that organisations susceptible to these attacks should adequately and proactively deploy solutions that will mitigate such incidences from occurring. He stated that their partnership with Forcepoint is to deploy cutting edge IT solutions for all types of industries in the country. According to him, “Infodata is partnering Forcepoint to provide IT solutions to all types of industries in the country, like financial services providers, telecommunications, oil and gas and so on. “So the solutions are quite broad and they consolidate these solutions to be able to provide cybersecurity solutions for web, emails, DLP and so on. These solutions are focused around human centric and security. So what Infodata has done is to partner with them to deliver these solutions to the local market,” he said. Udensi emphasised that we can check the prevalence of cyber security challenges as being witnessed in Nigeria today by deploying solutions like Forcepoint to enable us identify and proactively mitigate some of these incidences.
He further revealed that Ransomeware is expected to evolve in 2018 and beyond more than it already has now.
He added that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will take a bit of the cybersecurity burden and that the Internet of things (IoT) and serverless apps will increase consumer vulnerability.
