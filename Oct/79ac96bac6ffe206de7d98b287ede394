By Hammed Shittu in Ilorin The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara State, Alhaji Abdulrahaman Abdulrazaq, Wednesday said that only unity among members of the party will guarantee victory for APC in the 2019 general elections in the state. Speaking at a consultative forum for APC members on “imperative of unity and party loyalty towards good governance in the state” on Wednesday in Ilorin, Abdulrasaq said that, a house divided against itself cannot stand. Abdulrazaq, while commending the disposition of his co-contestants in the last governorship primary in ensuring that the party achieved proper reconciliation, said that, “there can be no better time to address the issue of unity and party loyalty than a time as this”. He said, “First lap of our electioneering has been concluded and the stage is now set for a robust and engaging election campaign. “As we are all aware, things will fall apart when the centre cannot hold. As a party man, I urge us all to embrace unity and togetherness. “We must avoid anything that stands as a threat to our unity as a party because we can only achieve our aim of bringing about good governance to our people if we put heads together, speak in one voice and chart a common course”. He advised members of the party to be up and doing in the struggle to ensure the electoral victory of the party. Abdulrasaq who also called on the members of the party in the three senatorial districts to start mobilising support for the party said thus would go a long way in selling his candidature and other candidates for various elective positions. He therefore promised to do everything possible to maintain contact with all the stakeholders and members of the party so as to bring everyone together under one banner for the electoral success of the party in the state.
