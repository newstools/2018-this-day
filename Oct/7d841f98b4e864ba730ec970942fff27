Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho will not be punished by the Football Association for his part in the injury-time fracas at Chelsea on Saturday. But Blues coach Marco Ianni has been charged with improper conduct. The incident occurred when Ianni celebrated Chelsea’s 96th-minute equaliser in front of the United bench, sparking a retaliation from Mourinho. The FA said the Portuguese manager had been “formally reminded of his responsibilities” after the 2-2 draw. An FA spokesperson added: “Both clubs have received similar official reminders in terms of the behaviour expected of their staff and players at all times whilst in the technical area.” Ianni has until 18:00 BST on Thursday to respond to the charge. On Monday, Mourinho said Ianni had apologised to him and “deserves a second chance”. “I want to thank Chelsea and (Maurizio Sarri),” Mourinho said. “The young boy does not deserve more than what he got. “He apologised to me. He deserves a second chance – he doesn’t deserve to be sacked. He went through a situation where he recognises he was wrong. “I hope everybody does the same as I did and do not disturb the career of a great guy. Probably someone with great potential. I’m not happy at all with more than that.”
