The Federal High Court, Abuja, last week, dismissed a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/457/2018 and filed by the Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, challenging his summons by the Senate. Justice John Tsoho said IGâ€™s suit constituted an abuse of court process and subjudice. Idris had approached the court for an order restraining the Senate and its leadership from insisting he should personally appear before them to respond to questions involving police arrest of Senator Dino Melaye. And now that the court has spoken, perhaps, Idris would muster the decency to respect the rule of law and not dismiss this ruling like he is wont to disobey presidential instructions. It goes without saying that the IG has caused more confusion than add value in the current democratic engagement, thus, disrespect for the rule of law is a familiar practice. He would not have shocked anyone if he brushes this aside. At a time when national discourse was beginning to interrogate the loyalty of state security apparatus, with a view to entrenching a professionally driven institution only loyal to the state and guided by the constitution, the partisanship of the IG is becoming very worrisome. A few days back, the police tear-gassed leading opposition politicians including the Senate President, Bukola Saraki; National Chairman of the PDP, Uche Secondus; Sule Lamido; Senators Musa Kwankwaso, Dino Melaye, Ben Murray Bruce among others; and invited them to appear before a police investigating team on charges of alleaged disturbance of public peace. This is coming on the heels of an Abuja court judgement which ruled against his refusal to honour an invitation by the Senate.
