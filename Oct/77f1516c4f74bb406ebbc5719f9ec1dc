Sources said the bandits who came in large number, opened fire at the policemen on arrival at the company and the policemen responded and succeeded in repelling what appeared to be armed robbery attack. The bandits were said to have fled in a vehicle before police reinforcement arrived the area. Those corpses of the deceased officers and those injured were taken to St. Gerald Catholic Hospital, Kakuri, Kaduna.

However, a senior police officer who pleaded anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the press, confirmed the incident.
