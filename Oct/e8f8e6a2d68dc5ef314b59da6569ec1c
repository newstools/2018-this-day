By Vanessa Obioha with Agency Reports Todd Harrell, the founding member and former bassist of the rock band 3 Doors Down has been sentenced to 10 years in Mississippi state prison for possession of a firearm by a felon. Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Robert Krebs found him guilty during a hearing Thursday. Authorities responded to Harrell’s home after an alarm went off in June. Harrell’s wife told deputies they had got into an argument that turned physical. While deputies were talking to the couple, they noticed guns and drugs in the home. Harrell is no stranger to jail terms. In 2013, he was sentenced to two years in prison for causing a fatal crash in Nashville. In 2015, he testified to being addicted to prescription drugs and was speeding. Harrell was suspended by the band after a second-offense DUI in 2012.
