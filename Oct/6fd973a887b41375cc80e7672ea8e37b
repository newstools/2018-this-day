Mercedes-Benz sold 202,819 vehicles worldwide in September (-8.2%) and was at the high prior-year level in the first nine months of the year with sales of 1,715,087 units
(-0.1%). In the third quarter of 2018, 526,255 vehicles with the three-pointed star were delivered to customers (-8.2%). With more than 200,000 units sold last month, sales in September were for Mercedes-Benz as a car manufacturer in the premium segment on a high level. In addition, Mercedes-Benz certified its entire fleet for Europe according to the WLTP standard with effect as of September 1. Certified vehicles are already on their way to the retailers, but despite the on-going strong demand, it was not possible to fulfil all customers’ wishes already in September. Compared with the best September for unit sales achieved last year, sales were also impacted by delays in certification in some international markets and by model changes. In a highly competitive environment, the brand with the three-pointed star maintained its market leadership as the premium brand with the highest number of new registrations in September in the markets UK, Italy, France, Russia, Switzerland, Portugal, Sweden, Turkey, Japan, Australia, the USA and Mexico, among others. “I am delighted that Mercedes-Benz has maintained the high level of prior-year sales in the first nine months of the year despite the challenges we faced in the third quarter. It is our goal to ensure that our customers can enjoy receiving their new vehicles as soon as possible – and this is exactly what our teams are currently working on intensively,” stated Britta Seeger, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG responsible for Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales. “With the GLE, we presented the latest model of our most successful SUV ever to the public at the Paris Motor Show. Mercedes-Benz SUVs have been in the fast lane with our customers since the beginning of the year, with over 610,000 units sold worldwide.” Mercedes-Benz unit sales by region and market In Europe, Mercedes-Benz sold 91,609 vehicles in September (-9.4%) and a total of 688,956 units in the first nine months of the year (-4.7%).
